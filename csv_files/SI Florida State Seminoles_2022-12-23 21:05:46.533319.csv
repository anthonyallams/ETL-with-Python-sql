The final few days of Florida State's 2022 season have arrived. It'll be a little different since the Seminoles are playing on a Thursday night in what will be their first postseason appearance under head coach Mike Norvell. There is plenty of optimism around the program as it enters the Cheez-It Bowl matchup against Oklahoma on a five-game winning streak. The success during the second half of the season included rivalry wins against Miami (45-3) and Florida (45-38) as the 'Noles earned the title of State Champions for the first time since 2016.

The game against the Sooners will feature two premier brands in college football that are working their way back toward the top of the sport. New head coach Brent Venables is beginning to establish a foundation for Oklahoma on top of a strong 2023 recruiting class. 
Ahead of the matchup with the Sooners, Florida State released its weekly depth chart with six days remaining until the two face off. There were a couple of changes to take note of for the Seminoles.
Redshirt sophomore wide receiver Darion Williamson appears on the two-deep as the third option to starter Mycah Pittman and primary backup Kentron Poitier. This is the first time that Williamson has made his way onto the depth chart since being injured in September against Boston College.
There has been a flip-flop at tight end as former starter Camren McDonald and former backup Preston Daniel have switched positions. McDonald is now listed as a co-backup alongside Jackson West to starter Markeston Douglas. Daniel has been elevated to a starting spot ahead of primary backup Wyatt Rector.
Redshirt freshman Shyheim Brown is now regarded as a co-starter alongside veteran Akeem Dent at the Buck safety position. Brown took over the starting job against the Gators in the regular-season finale.
With the redshirt freshman being listed at Buck, redshirt senior backup Jarques McClellion switched to the other safety spot and is now the primary backup to Jammie Robinson. That was Brown's old spot on the two-deep.
Lastly, players that have entered the NCAA Transfer Portal who are no longer with the program have been removed from the depth chart. Backup defensive tackle Jarrett Jackson and backup defensive back/returner Sam McCall are off the two-deep.
In their place, Fabien Lovett and Dennis Briggs are listed as co-starters at one of the defensive tackle positions. Trey Benson is now the sole starter at one of the kickoff return spots with no backup listed. Mycah Pittman and Lawrance Toafili are listed at the other kick return spot.
The full depth chart can be viewed below.

Tough decisions are being made around the country as players debate whether to declare for the 2023 NFL Draft, return for another year with their current program, or explore the NCAA Transfer Portal. Florida State has yet to officially lose anyone to the draft but the expectation is that safety Jammie Robinson and defensive tackle Fabien Lovett will pursue professional careers following the Cheez-It Bowl.

Earlier this work, former Seminole running back and one-time five-star prospect, Khalan Laborn, signed with Young Money APAA Sports, Dwayne 'Lil Wayne' Carter's sports agency. That effectively means Laborn will be declaring for and focusing on the upcoming draft over the next couple of months.
The Virginia native spent the 2022 season at Marshall after sitting out two years. He broke out for the Thundering Herd and had one of the best seasons in school history. Laborn rushed 302 times for 1,513 yards and 16 touchdowns while catching 16 passes for 116 yards. It was the most rushing yards in a season for a running back in the program since 2014.
He started off his final campaign with seven straight games with 100+ rushing yards and at least one touchdown, including a career-high 191 yards and two scores against Gardner-Webb. Overall, Laborn recorded nine games with 100+ rushing yards and only fumbled twice.
Laborn began his career at Florida State after being one of the most highly-rated prospects in the 2017 class alongside fellow top running back Cam Akers. He redshirted during his true freshman before a serious knee injury ended his second season before it ever really got started. Laborn returned in 2019, totaling 63 rushes for 297 yards and four touchdowns while catching 10 passes for 66 yards.
The 5-foot-11, 212-pound running back stuck with the Seminoles when head coach Mike Norvell replaced Willie Taggart in December 2019. However, he was dismissed from the program that offseason following a violation of team rules. Laborn was reportedly set to go the JUCO route with Garden City Community College in 2021 but didn't end up following through.
Instead, he earned his bachelor's degree from Florida State which allowed him to grad-transfer to Marshall. Laborn made the most of his second chance and there's a shot that he ends up getting drafted.
Up first will be further cementing his name on the radar. Laborn will have an opportunity to do just that at the 2023 Hula Bowl on Saturday, January 14.

Florida State had a busy couple of days during the Early Signing Period. The Seminoles ended up officially signing 23 prospects - 16 high school recruits, one Junior College transfer, and six NCAA Transfer Portal prospects - but not without plenty of drama.
The program secured two uncommitted prospects on Wednesday; three-star defensive back Edwin Joseph and three-star offensive lineman Chris Otto. The Seminoles were also able to win out in a wild recruitment for four-star safety Conrad Hussey, who flipped his longtime commitment from Penn State. 
There was one black mark on the class as four-star defensive end Keldric Faulk flipped to Auburn.

https://www.si.com/college/fsu/football/former-florida-state-assistant-coach-hired-as-head-coach-at-hbcu,Former Florida State assistant coach hired as head coach at HBCU,"The deal is reportedly for three years as the longtime assistant earns his first job leading a program.
Coaching changes are in full flux across the country and more moves are becoming official now that the Early Signing Period is wrapping up. Florida State has yet to make a move to this point but it's anticipated that the majority of the staff will stay put entering the offseason.

While no longer in Tallahassee, at least one coach with ties to the Seminoles is going to get a shot at a head coaching job in 2023.
On Thursday, Arkansas Pine Bluff announced it was hiring Alonzo Hampton as the 22nd head coach in program history. The deal is reportedly for three years according to ESPN's Pete Thamel.
Hampton was at Florida State for one season in 2018 as a member of former head coach Willie Taggart's inaugural staff, where he served as special teams coordinator. Punt returner D.J. Matthews was one of the bright spots of the unit, as he averaged 13.5 yards per return, which was among the best in the country. Matthews returned five punts for a career-high 145 yards in the Seminoles' loss to Miami, including a 74-yard punt return for a score.
Following the season, he spent a year at Arkansas as a Defensive Analyst before landing at UL-Monroe in 2021. Hampton held the role of assistant head coach and safeties coach last season before moving to special teams coordinator this past year.
Previously, he coached with Taggart at three other stops outside of Florida State; Oregon (2017, defensive analyst), South Florida (2015-16, special teams coordinator/defensive backs coach), and Western Kentucky (2011-12, defensive backs coach). 
Coincidentally, Hampton began his college coaching career at Arkansas Pine Bluff in 2006 and stayed until Taggart hired him away following the 2010 season. He held roles such as cornerbacks coach, defensive backs coach, and defensive coordinator during his first stint with the Golden Lions. Hampton also has coached at three different high schools.
In a statement, Hampton expressed his excitement at taking over for Arkansas Pine Bluff.
""I'm excited to be named 22nd head football coach at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff. This institution gave me my first opportunity to coach college football in 2006,"" Hampton said. ""This is a special day for my family and we are grateful as we look forward to pushing this program to new heights. Also, it means more to come back to your home state. I've already reached out to all my friends throughout the state and told them to go purchase their season tickets and come support the Golden Lions. Again, I can't wait to get there and start building something special that our administration, faculty, staff, alumni and former players will be proud of for years to come.""
The Golden Lions compiled a 5-17 record over the last two seasons and parted ways with former head coach Doc Gamble during the middle of the 2022 season. The program is 2-14 in conference play over the last two years.
Arkansas Pine Bluff went 4-1 during the 2021 spring season and the team was named SWAC West Champions. The Golden Lions won the HBCU National Championship in 2012.
There are more ties to Florida State than one in the Hampton family. Alonzo's son, 2024 athlete Ashton Hampton, plays locally in Tallahassee at Florida High School and has earned an offer from the Seminoles. A two-way player, he caught 32 passes for 630 yards and nine touchdowns on offense while recording 48 tackles, 5 tackles for loss, 8 pass deflections, and one interception on defense as a junior.
Hampton is the second head coach in the Willie Taggart tree, joining Mario Cristobal, who also worked at Oregon in 2017.

Florida State has been on the wrong side of multiple Early Signing Day surprises over the past couple of years. 
READ MORE: Early Signing Period Tracker for the Florida State Seminoles
Well, like their play on the field, maybe the Seminoles' luck on the recruiting trail is beginning to shift in the right direction.
On Thursday, four-star safety Conrad Hussey announced that he was flipping his commitment from Penn State and signing with Florida State. The Seminoles won out for Hussey over the Nittany Lions and Miami, who hosted him on the final weekend prior to the NCAA Dead Period.
Hussey only visited Florida State once leading up to his decision but the coaching staff has stayed in contact with him behind the scenes. The efforts from members of the staff like head coach Mike Norvell and defensive backs coach Marcus Woodson proved to be fruitful in the end. Hussey is an immensely talented prospect at a position of need.
It's possible that both of the Seminoles' starting safeties in Jammie Robinson and Akeem Dent move on following the season. Robinson has stated multiple times that he's played his final game in Doak Campbell Stadium while Dent is still weighing his options. That means there is a chance that Hussey gets involved in the defense very early in his career.
The Florida native grew up a fan of the Seminoles. He was blown away during his Official Visit to Tallahassee which is part of the reason that he ended up at Florida State.
""FSU was great, I'm not going to lie. I like everything about it, what they had to show me,"" Hussey said. ""I appreciate the love that they showed me too. Everything about FSU was like how they told me before, about family and culture so I really respected that.""
The St. Thomas Aquinas product will enroll at Florida State during the summer. He recorded 29 tackles, 5 pass deflections, and 3 interceptions during his senior season, according to MaxPreps.
The 6-foot, 190-pound defensive back is regarded as the No. 164 overall prospect, the No. 11 S, and the No. 38 recruit in the state of Florida in the 2023 class according to 247Sports.
As of now, Florida State holds 17 commitments in its 2023 class, which ranks No. 17 overall in the country according to 247Sports.

https://www.si.com/college/fsu/football/hykeem-williams-travis-hunter-clash-over-early-signing-day-comments,"Hykeem Williams, Travis Hunter clash over Early Signing Day comments","Florida State's top commit and a former top commit sparred on social media.
Florida State officially signed five-star wide receiver Hykeem Williams on Wednesday afternoon. Williams was the first five-star prospect to ink with the Seminoles under head coach Mike Norvell and the highest-ranked receiver to come in since 2015.

Despite late pushes from Colorado, Texas A&M, and Miami, there was no drama with Williams' ceremony during the Early Signing Period. Decked out in custom Florida State gear alongside his family, high school coaches, and supporters, he made things official with the 'Noles despite sending in his actual signing papers hours earlier.
It was a far cry from the scenario that Florida State's coaching staff dealt with just over a year ago when the No. 1 recruit in the 2022 class, Travis Hunter, flipped to Jackson State in a moment that shocked the country.
While taking in the moment after the conclusion of his high school recruitment, Williams put out a statement that made him instantly beloved by Seminole fans as he responded to a comment on his Instagram Live.
""Go 'Noles, Baby! Ain't no Travis Hunter over here,"" Williams proclaimed live to hundreds of fans. ""We locked in, time to work.""
The message clearly struck a nerve with the former Florida State commitment, who signed with Jackson State before announcing his decision to transfer to Colorado on Wednesday night. 
Hunter responded to Williams on Thursday afternoon, ""could never be me.""
It's worth noting that Hunter was committed to Florida State for over a year and half before he 'shocked the world' by flipping to Deion Sanders and the Tigers. During the course of his pledge to the Seminoles, he talked a big game about how he was coming to Tallahassee to turn the program around.
Just check out this quote from Hunter that came less than three weeks before he turned heel.
""I'm fixing to go in and rebuild the program like Deion Sanders did when he played there,"" Hunter said. ""I want to go make a statement and show everybody that I can go anywhere and play any opponent. Something I've always wanted to do is play for Florida State.""
In the end, those words turned out to be a load of nonsense.
That was seemingly Williams' point from the beginning as he tossed another barb directly at Hunter.
""You right. I'm solid.""
There's no doubt that Williams showed his loyalty to Florida State since making his original commitment in September. He only took one trip to nearby Miami outside of viewing the Seminoles three times in Doak Campbell Stadium. Williams also publicly recruited for the program as he vocally pushed for five-star running back Cedric Baxter Jr. and played a factor in three-star athlete Edwin Joseph signing with FSU.
Travis Hunter is correct.
Hykeem Williams could never be like him. 
Williams stuck with the people who were loyal to him and followed through with his dream while Hunter's motives were clearly focused on something else.
The 6-foot-3, 200-pound wide receiver will arrive at Florida State to enroll in January. That means he'll have the opportunity to participate in the Tour of Duty, spring practice, and summer conditioning leading up to his first season at the college level.
The Seminoles are returning a fair amount of depth on the outside in 2023 but Williams may end up being too talented to keep off the field. He has the potential to develop into a special offensive weapon in Tallahassee.
Williams recently released custom merchandise to celebrate his signing with Florida State. Check it out HERE.

The NCAA Transfer Portal has been filling up at a rapid pace ever since the FBS winter window opened on December 5. Players around the country have until January 18, 2023 to declare their intentions to test out the portal.

On Thursday afternoon, Florida State saw another scholarship player depart from the program to explore their options elsewhere. Grad-transfer cornerback Malik Feaster announced his intentions on social media to utilize his final season of collegiate eligibility elsewhere.
Feaster is the fourth defensive back to move on from the Seminoles, joining Sam McCall (cornerback/safety), Sidney Williams (safety/linebacker), and Demorie Tate (cornerback).
After beginning his career at FCS Jacksonville State, Feaster entered the portal last summer and committed to Florida State after fall camp had already begun. That left him behind the eight-ball and made it tough for Feaster to make a significant impact on the defense. He appeared in the first four games of 2022, only playing 19 total snaps on defense, before sitting out the remainder of the season to preserve his redshirt.
The Georgia native spent four seasons with the Gamecocks. In 40 appearances, he recorded 118 tackles, 4 tackles for loss, 24 pass breakups, 3 interceptions, and two fumble recoveries. That included 42 total tackles in 2021 and a career-high 11 tackles, one interception, and one forced fumble against Stephen F. Austin.
Florida State is expected to return multiple veterans at cornerback in 2023 including Renardo Green, Jarrian Jones, Greedy Vance, Kevin Knowles, Omarion Cooper, and Azareye'h Thomas. The Seminoles also signed KJ Kirkland, Ja'Bril Rawls, Quindarrius Jones, and Edwin Joseph during the Early Signing Period.
Keep an eye on the portal to return a favor for the Seminoles too. Florida State hosted Virginia cornerback transfer Fentrell 'Deuce' Cypress II last weekend for an Official Visit. Cypress is expected to make a decision in the near future.

Although they've played just seven times, Oklahoma (6-6) has No. 13 Florida State's (9-3) number. 
The Sooners lead the all-time series 6-1, with two wins in the home-and-home series the programs played in 2010-11.
READ MORE: Early Signing Period Tracker for the Florida State Seminoles
Florida State ended its regular season with five straight wins and defeated both in-state rivals for the first time since 2016.
Meanwhile, under first-year head coach Brent Venables, Oklahoma dropped three of its final four games and finished with its worst record since 1998. 
The two meet in the Cheez-It Bowl on Dec. 29 and Sooners players have begun speaking in preparation for the contest.
Redshirt junior Dillion Gabriel leads an Oklahoma offense averaging 32.9 points per game. In 11 games, Gabriel threw for 2,925 yards, 24 touchdowns and six interceptions.
Gabriel said Florida State's well-balanced and played exceptionally during the second half of the regular season.
""[They're] really talented, they obviously played really well ... definitely towards the end of the season started to get into their groove,"" Gabriel said. ""Their offense played really well, defense is playing lights out on their end. They're a really good team and we got to come ready to play as every week because it's college football, [you] got to show up and show out.""
Gabriel praised FSU's defense and specifically credited redshirt junior Jammie Robinson. Robinson led the Seminoles with 86 tackles and ranked second in pass deflections (four).
""They got a good front, I'd say seven as well,"" Gabriel said. ""Their safeties are really talented as well ... No. 10, [he's] just athletic, has made a lot of plays and done really well for himself.""
Junior wide receiver Marvin Mims Jr. served as Gabriel's primary target in 2022. Mims Jr finished with 1,006 receiving yards, 550 yards more than the Sooners' next-closest receiver.
Mims Jr said FSU proved its place as one of the premier Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) programs.
""Honestly, one of the best teams in the ACC,"" Mims Jr said. ""They put it on film for sure ... a 9-3 football team, [you] can't take that lightly at all. It'll be a good matchup for us, but at the end of the day they have really good players on that team and they're going to make their plays too.""
After senior running back Eric Gray opted out in preparation for the NFL Draft, Oklahoma's backfield turns to freshman running back Jovante Barnes. The former four-star recruit racked up 411 rushing yards on 89 carries in 10 games. 
Barnes chose the Sooners over several schools, including the Seminoles, and said he's excited about the opportunity.
""It's gonna be a great time,"" Barnes said. ""Obviously, Florida State's a great team ... like you said, it was a school I was looking to go to. Their defense is incredible. They have fast players, they have physical players, they can almost do everything so it's going to be a good battle against us two and I feel like it's going to be great competition.""

Los Angeles Chargers' strong safety Derwin James was named a starting safety for the American Football Conference (AFC).
Through 12 regular season games, James has totaled 106 tackles (61 solo), five tackles for loss, four pass deflections and two forced fumbles. He's missed the last two games with a hamstring injury.
It's the third Pro Bowl appearance for the former Seminole after being selected No. 17 overall in the 2018 NFL Draft. 
Before the 2022 season, Los Angeles and James agreed on a four-year, $76.5 million contract extension which made him the highest-paid safety in the league.
In the National Football Conference (NFC), Carolina Panthers defensive end Brian Burns was selected as one of six defensive linemen from the conference.
Burns has already reached a career-high 10.5 sacks with three weeks left in the regular season. He's also tallied 58 tackles (14 for loss) and 18 quarterback hits.
It's the second Pro Bowl appearance for Burns, who is eligible for a contract extension in the 2023 offseason. Burns was selected No. 16 overall in the 2019 NFL Draft and Carolina picked up his fifth-year option last spring.
Burns and the Panthers suit up against the Detroit Lions on Dec. 24, while James Jr and the Chargers take on the Indianapolis Colts on Dec. 26.
Philadelphia Eagles offensive guard Landon Dickerson was also named a Pro Bowler. Dickerson spent 2016-18 at Florida State before transferring to Alabama.
The Pro Bowl Games is on Feb. 5, 2023, at noon. It'll be the first time in NFL history the Pro Bowl is a flag football game.
