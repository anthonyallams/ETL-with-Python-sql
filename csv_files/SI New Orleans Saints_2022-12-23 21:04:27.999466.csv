https://www.si.com/nfl/saints/editorial-opinion/saint-pass-defense-browns-passing-attack,Saints Defense Looks to Pounce on Erratic Browns Passing Attack,"New Orleans will need to shut down Cleveland's running game, but must also stop the Browns passing attack from getting any momentum to gift wrap a Christmas Eve win.
The New Orleans Saints trek north to take on the Cleveland Browns in a Saturday afternoon game on Christmas Eve. New Orleans (5-9) needs a win to maintain their slim playoff chances, as do the 6-8 Browns.
Weather is expected to affect both offenses on Saturday. A winter storm forecasts potential heavy snowfall, freezing temperatures, and high winds starting Friday into Christmas Day. It's the kind of weather that would seem to favor the defenses but might be perfect for the Browns' offensive style. 
New Orleans comes into this game, allowing 327.6 yards per game defensively to rank 11th in the NFL. Those are solid numbers, but the Saints have forced only ten turnovers, the fewest in the league, and have been prone to breakdowns in crucial moments. Even more concerning has been the team's struggles against the run that has plagued them all year. 
The Saints take on a Browns squad that added a big-time quarterback in Deshaun Watson this offseason. Watson is entering his fourth game after an 11-game suspension for an offense that ranks eighth in total yardage with 362.6 per outing. Most of that is thanks to a physical fifth-ranked running game. 
If New Orleans manages to slow Cleveland's running attack, will the Browns be able to win the game through the air?
New Orleans has allowed only one 300-yard passer and held eight opponents under 200 yards through the air this season. However, key breakdowns cost them late losses to Minnesota, Cincinnati, and Tampa Bay. 
The Saints' pass rush started slowly in 2022, but since Week 3 have been among the league leaders in sacks and pressures. Veteran DE Cam Jordan is having another strong year. Jordan has 5.5 sacks and 13 pressures in a down year by his standards, but still creates consistent disruption along the edge. 
New Orleans has one of the league's most talented defensive end rotations. Marcus Davenport complements Jordan well. He has just a half sack, but his 14 pressures lead the team. Carl Granderson, Payton Turner, and Tanoh Kpassagnon provide terrific depth and have combined for 7 sacks and 14 QB hits. 
The defensive tackle has been a weak area for the team most of the year, but they've made some noise in recent weeks. David Onyemata, Shy Tuttle, Kentavius Street, and Malcolm Roach have contributed little most of the year. However, the majority of their combined 9.5 sacks and 21 QB hits have occurred over the last month. 
New Orleans linebackers have been a model of consistency all season.  Unfortunately, LB Pete Werner will miss his fifth of six games, this time because of a hamstring injury.  However, Kaden Elliss has played like a star in his absence. 
Elliss, a fourth-year pro, has 5.5 sacks and 64 tackles this season.  Both numbers are career bests.  Forty-nine of those stops and 4.5 sacks have come in the last six games since Werner has been hurt.  A physical downhill player, Elliss has also shown marked improvement in his coverage skills, which was thought to be a weakness. 
The most important cog in the defense remains LB Demario Davis, who was just named to the NFC Pro Bowl roster.  Davis has a team-high 6.5 sacks and 89 tackles, including nine for loss and an interception along with five passes broken up.  He's an elite run defender and devastating blitzer, but also has the ability to cover backs and tight ends all over the field.
Star CB Marshon Lattimore looks closer to returning from abdominal injuries, but will likely miss his 10th straight game this week in the cold weather.  Rookie CB Alontae Taylor, a second-round choice, is emerging as a star in Lattimore's absence.
Despite playing in just eight games, Taylor leads the team with 10 passes broken up.  He's taken on Lattimore's role of often shadowing an opponent’s top receiver and gets targeted frequently, but is giving up only 49.2% completion percentage in man coverage. 
Fellow corner Paulson Adebo has struggled a bit in his second season.  Adebo has dealt with injuries and a slump.  He's broken up six throws, but has allowed over 72% completion percentage when targeted.  Still, Adebo is a capable corner with high upside.  Veteran Bradley Roby is an above average third corner with starting experience who handles slot duties. 
Safety has been the much bigger disappointment.  Tyrann Mathieu has two of the defense's three interceptions, but has been a liability because of poor coverage support and awful tackling.
Marcus Maye has had a slightly better season, but has been in and out with injuries and may miss Saturday's contest with a shoulder issue.  P.J. Williams (knee) could also be a game-time decision, making this position even more vulnerable. 
Watson's actions off the field are reprehensible, but on the field he's a rare talent.  He's been a little slow to get into a rhythm after almost two years of inactivity.  In three games, Watson has completed 61% of his throws with two touchdowns and two interceptions, but has thrown for less than 170 yards twice. 
Cleveland's top target is reliable veteran WR Amari Cooper, who has 67 catches for 932 yards and 7 touchdowns.  Cooper is a terrific route runner who has six 100-yard outings and four more of over 70.
Third-year WR Donovan Peoples-Jones has blossomed into an adequate number two receiver.  He has 57 receptions for 782 yards and tests defenses with a combination of physical play and downfield speed.  Rookie third-round pick David Bell, who has 23 catches for 196 yards, has also flashed solid potential. 
David Njoku is one of the league's most athletic tight ends.  Njoku, who has 51 catches for 551 yards, tests defenses with his downfield speed and is an outstanding open field runner.  Third-year TE Harrison Bryant is a bit undersized for the position, but has been a solid receiver with 27 catches for 200 yards.
The Browns have a terrific duo of running backs in Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt.  Chubb has carried the rushing load, but both backs are lethal weapons on swing passes in the open field.  They've combined for 65 catches and 354 yards. 
Backup QB Jacoby Brissett averaged 237 yards passing with 12 touchdowns and 6 interceptions during Watson's 11-game suspension.  The Browns still bring Brissett in for some snaps.  It's usually as a runner, but he provides a threat to defenses as a thrower. 
Cleveland has a physical offensive line that bullies opponents in the trenches.  It's built for their run-based scheme, but they're also big-bodied pass protectors and have had trouble with speed rushers. 
New Orleans has the athletic pass rushers to give Cleveland pass protection problems. However, potentially bad footing could prevent the Saints from lining their ends wide to spread the Browns protection and open up chances for inside blitzes.
Weather and field conditions could force both teams to limit their passing game. That plays into Cleveland's strategy of usually relying on the run. It also tests a New Orleans run defense that has struggled most of the year. 
The Saints prefer to play a lot of man coverage. High winds and especially field conditions could force them to more short zones. If New Orleans can shut down the Browns on the ground, a major key to the game, then their ability to tackle short passes and minimize gains would bottle up Cleveland's offense and turn the game into a field position battle. 
Facing a winter storm and dealing with an offense even more limited by several injuries, the onus will be on the Saints defense to gift wrap a Christmas Eve victory. ","Sports Illustrated New Orleans Saints News, Analysis and More","New orleans saints, Marcus davenport, Jacoby brissett, Deshaun watson, Cameron jordan, David njoku, Alontae taylor, Amari cooper, Saints news, Donovan peoples-jones, Demario davis, David onyemata, New orleans saints news, Kaden elliss, Tyrann mathieu, Paulso adebo, Cleveland browns, Editorial / opinion",Bob rose,"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 14:30:37 GMT","New Orleans will need to shut down Cleveland's running game, but must also stop the Browns passing attack from getting any momentum to gift wrap a Christmas Eve win.",https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NjQ3ODIzOTAyMzE5Nzc4/usatsi_11261473_168388561_lowres.jpg

Kirk Merritt has been signed from the practice squad in a corresponding move.
The Saints are placing Jarvis Landry on injured reserve Thursday. Kirk Merritt is being signed to the team's active roster from the practice squad, according to his agent Mike McCartney.
It's been a tough season for Landry, as he'll finish out with just 272 yards and a touchdown on 25 receptions in his 9 games played in 2022. Landry battled back from an ankle injury that he suffered against the Panthers early in the season, suffered a setback, and then returned to action. He was ruled out for Week 16's matchup against the Browns on the team's final injury report due to an ankle injury.
Landry, who turned 30 at the end of November, is set to become an unrestricted free agent in March.","Sports Illustrated New Orleans Saints News, Analysis and More","Nfl, Saints injury update, Jarvis landry, Saints, Saints news, News, New orleans saints, New orleans saints news, Kirk merritt, Nfl week 16, New orleans saints injuries",John hendrix,"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 21:00:17 GMT","Jarvis Landry is heading to injured reserve, effectively ending his Saints season.

The Saints put out their final injury report of the week ahead of Saturday's matchup against the Browns. Four players have been ruled out for Week 16, which include two of the team's starting wide receivers. Here's how things look against Cleveland.
OUT: Chris Olave (hamstring), Jarvis Landry (ankle), Dwayne Washington (illness), Pete Werner (hamstring)
QUESTIONABLE: Marshon Lattimore (abdomen), Marcus Maye (shoulder), Adam Trautman (ankle), P.J. Williams (knee), Andrus Peat (illness)
Among those not spotted at practice Thursday included Landry, Olave, Werner, Washington, and Peat. Jarvis Landry is going on injured reserve, effectively ending his season. Dennis Allen said after practice that Washington is dealing with cluster headaches, something that could take 3-5 weeks to recover from. 
All signs are pointing to Marshon Lattimore returning and starting for the Saints, but Dennis Allen said they'll make a decision on him and Marcus Maye tomorrow. Calvin Throckmorton likely slides in at right guard in place of Cesar Ruiz, who got hurt on the final play of the game against the Falcons and is on injured reserve. Should Peat be unable to play, then keep an eye on veteran Josh Andrews. ","Sports Illustrated New Orleans Saints News, Analysis and More","New orleans saints, Pete werner, News, Andrus peat, Jarvis landry, Chris olave, Nfl week 16, Dwayne washington, New orleans saints news, Saints news, New orleans saints injury report, Saints injury report, Saints, Nfl",John hendrix,"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 20:46:02 GMT","The Saints have ruled out four of their players ahead of Saturday's game against the Browns, which include two of their main weapons at wide receiver.",https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MTAwNDcwODU0MTk4Nzg5/chris-olave-and-landry.jpg
https://www.si.com/nfl/saints/editorial-opinion/saints-browns-game-preview-week-16,Saints vs. Browns: What to Watch For,"Both the Saints and Browns need to produce a win on Saturday, and are hoping for an early Christmas gift of cheer in Week 16. However, it will come down to who executes the best.
The Saints (5-9) and Browns (6-8) meet at FirstEnergy Stadium on Saturday as part of a very full day of NFL Week 16 games before Christmas. Both teams are trying to keep their playoff hopes alive, with them both being 12th in their respective conference. Here's some things we're paying close attention to leading up to the game.
THE WEATHER: It's going to be a dominant storyline going into the game, and for good reason. There's a Winter Storm warning in the area overnight, which is why the team will be leaving Thursday after practice. Snow, wind, and extremely low temperatures will be featured in this game. The wind might be the most significant when it comes to throws and kicks, and naturally someone like Andy Dalton is very familiar with the Ohio cold weather. However, he's not the only one.
THE GUARD PLAN: Calvin Throckmorton looks to start in place of Cesar Ruiz, who landed on injured reserve this week due to a Lisfranc injury he suffered late in the game against the Falcons. The Saints could also use a rotation like they have before with rookie Lewis Kidd, but either way it's a big loss for the New Orleans offense, who will simply have to find a way to execute without Ruiz. This looks to be a game where it'll be won in the trenches, and Baltimore put up nearly 200 rushing yards on the Browns last week, but still lost.

CORNER LOOKS: Marshon Lattimore looks like he's been a bit more active at practice, which might be a good sign of him returning to the field. It's obviously been a disappointing season for the team's top corner, who got hurt on a fluke play that he shouldn't have been guarding against in the first place. The interesting part is if Lattimore does go, who starts on the other side? Alontae Taylor has been playing excellent, and he's been someone that can't be kept off the field. However, Paulson Adebo has also played well, very similar to the player we saw in training camp. As Dennis Allen said on Wednesday during his conference call with the media, it's a good problem to have.
RECEIVER AVAILABILITY: Jarvis Landry (ankle) was a recent addition to the injury report, and rookie Chris Olave (hamstring) hasn't practiced the first two days. Of course, it goes without saying that Tuesday's report was an estimated one, but the first look at the team saw the team without two of their top receiving threats. Thursday is a huge day for both, as well as Pete Werner, who has been out with a hamstring injury after making his return against the Falcons. ","Sports Illustrated New Orleans Saints News, Analysis and More","Marshon lattimore, Saints news, Lewis kidd, Nfl, Andy dalton, Saints, New orleans saints news, Paulson adebo, Nfl week 16, Calvin throckmorton, New orleans saints, Jarvis landry, Alontae taylor, Editorial / opinion, Chris olave, Pete werner",John hendrix,"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 15:15:00 GMT","Both the Saints and Browns need to produce a win on Saturday, and are hoping for an early Christmas gift of cheer in Week 16.

https://www.si.com/nfl/saints/news/saints-demario-davis-nfl-pro-bowl,Saints LB Demario Davis Among Pro Bowl Honorees,"Elite New Orleans LB Demario Davis earns a much-deserved honor on the NFC Pro Bowl team.
NFL Pro Bowl rosters were announced on Wednesday night.  The New Orleans Saints have one player on the 2023 Pro Bowl roster.  Linebacker Demario Davis earned the first Pro Bowl of his 11-year career.  Davis, who earned 1st Team All-Pro honors in 2019, had been snubbed several times in Pro Bowl voting. 
The 33-year-old Davis has been with the Saints for five years after spending five with the New York Jets and one with the Cleveland Browns.  He's one tackle away from his 10th consecutive season of at least 90 tackles and is closing in on his sixth straight year of at least 100 stops.
Davis leads the Saints with 89 tackles so far, including nine for loss.  He also leads the team with a career-high 6.5 sacks.  Davis also has 10 pressures, along with one interception and five passes broken up while allowing 62% completion percentage in coverage. 
A do-it-all defender, Davis is one of the league's best run defenders.  He possesses a rare combination of instincts, awareness, and athleticism.  Davis disrupts offenses with his blitzing ability, coverage skills, and his ferocious pursuit of the ball carrier. 
Former Saints DE Trey Hendrickson, now with the Bengals, was voted onto the AFC Pro Bowl roster.  Hendrickson played for the Saints from 2017 to 2020 as a third-round choice from Florida Atlantic.  He left New Orleans as a free agent, signing with Cincinnati and earning his first career Pro Bowl bid last season.  In 2022, Hendrickson has six sacks and 33 pressures.
The Pro Bowl will be played on February 5 in Las Vegas, it's second straight year in that venue.  This season, it will be a flag football game between the AFC and NFC that ends a week of skills competition between players from the two conferences. ","Sports Illustrated New Orleans Saints News, Analysis and More","New orleans saints, Nfl pro bowl, Saints news, Demario davis, New orleans saints news, News, Trey hendrickson, Pro bowl honors",Bob rose,"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 13:58:05 GMT",Elite New Orleans LB Demario Davis earns a much-deserved honor on the NFC Pro Bowl team.,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NjI0NDA4Mjc3NDkzMjcy/usatsi_19204790_168388561_lowres.jpg

https://www.si.com/nfl/saints/news/saints-wednesday-injury-report-week-16,Saints Wednesday Injury Report - Week 16,"New Orleans released their first official injury report for their Week 16 game at Cleveland. Initial reports aren't good for two key players on each side of the ball.
The 5-9 New Orleans Saints play at the 6-8 Cleveland Browns in Week 16.  It'll be a short work week for both teams, with the game taking place on Saturday - Christmas Eve. 
Inclement weather, with freezing wind chills and significant snow falls, are predicted in advance of the game.  New Orleans will fly out on Thursday after practice instead of Friday because of the forecast. 
The Saints didn't practice on Tuesday, but released their first official injury report of the week after Wednesday's practice. 
Chris Olave, WR (hamstring)
Pete Werner, LB (hamstring)
Jarvis Landry, WR (ankle)
Dwayne Washington, RB (illness)
Marshon Lattimore, CB (abdomen)
Ryan Ramczyk, RT (rest)
Marcus Maye, S (shoulder)
Adam Trautman, TE (ankle)
P.J. Williams, S (knee)
Landry wasn't listed on the team’s estimated injury report on Tuesday, but sat out of Wednesday's session with an ankle that's given him problems all year.  Washington, who missed last week's game against Atlanta, remains out of action. 
Olave, the team’s leading receiver, injured his hamstring during the win over the Falcons, causing him to spend some time in the injury tent but returning to the game.  He's not missed a game this year, but early prognosis for his participation on Saturday in freezing conditions doesn't look good. 
Werner returned to the lineup last week after missing four games with an ankle injury.  He played in 74% of the defensive snaps, but injured his hamstring during the Atlanta game. 
Lattimore, who has missed nine straight games, looks like he's closer to returning to action. According to Nick Underhill of NewOrleans.Football, Lattimore was more active in today's session.  He had been a light participant for the last two games before being listed as a game-time scratch. 
Maye and Trautman were both nicked up against Atlanta and look questionable to play against Cleveland as of mid-week.  Ramczyk has seen light practice duty during the week most of the year. 
New Orleans got C Erik McCoy back after a four-game injury absence, but placed RG Cesar Ruiz (foot) on injured reserve yesterday.  The Saints also announced that they signed LB Ty Summers off the Jacksonville Jaguars practice squad.  Summers will be on the active roster against Cleveland, likely serving on special teams. 
The Browns are also dealing with some significant injuries.  Running back Nick Chubb (foot), DE Myles Garrett (illness), DE Jadeveon Clowney (concussion), and S John Johnson (thigh) didn't practice on Tuesday or Wednesday for the Browns. ","Sports Illustrated New Orleans Saints News, Analysis and More","Jarvis landry, Pete werner, Saints news, New orleans saints, News, Marshon lattimore, Chris olave, Marcus maye, Cleveland browns, New orleans saints news, Adam trautman",Bob rose,"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 22:02:53 GMT",New Orleans released their first official injury report for their Week 16 game at Cleveland.

https://www.si.com/nfl/saints/editorial-opinion/saint-run-defense-browns-rushing-attack,Saints Must Halt Browns Ground Assault in Old-Fashioned Week 16 Battle,"The Saints performance against the run is the most surprisingly disappointing aspect of their game in 2022. Their slim postseason hopes depend on whether they can reverse that trend in Week 16 at Cleveland.
A 5-9 New Orleans Saints team heads north to face the 6-8 Cleveland Browns on Christmas Eve.  The Saints can still win the NFC South, but need a win here to keep any realistic hopes alive. 
New Orleans was expected to have one of the NFL's best defenses in 2022.  They've had their moments, especially over the last month, but have also suffered crucial breakdowns in key situations. 
The Saints rank 11th in total defense, giving up an average of 327.6 yards per game.  However, they rank last in turnovers forced (10) and have struggled on third downs.  Most concerning is the failures of a run defense that dominated opponents from 2018 through 2021.
They'll take on a physical Cleveland team that got QB Deshaun Watson back from suspension three weeks ago.  The Browns average 362.6 total yards per game, ranking 8th in the league.  While their passing attack has been erratic, they've had one of the NFL's most consistent ground games.
Inclement weather is expected for the game, likely increasing the importance of the running game.  
The Saints performance against the run is the most surprisingly disappointing aspect of their game in 2022.  Can they reverse that trend to keep slim postseason hopes alive?
- 22.5 points per game (17th)
- 132.6 rushing yards/game (23rd)
- 4.6 per rush (21st)
- 13 rushing touchdowns (15th)
- 63 tackles for loss 
- 41.4% 3rd Down Percentage (22nd)
New Orleans has held six opponents under 100 yards on the ground.  However, seven teams have plowed over them for at least 145 yards rushing, including an astounding three games of at least 200 on the ground.  Three runners have managed 100-yard outings against New Orleans, with seven others rushing for at least 70 yards.
Saints struggles start with the defensive tackle spot, although they've played far better over the last month.  For much of the year, the unit has been blown off the ball, allowing runners to get to the second level easily.  David Onyemata, Shy Tuttle, Kentavius Street, and Malcolm Roach have all shown flashes, but haven't caused consistent interior disruption. 
Veteran Cam Jordan leads a deep crew of talented defensive ends and leads the team with 10 tackles for loss.  Jordan, Marcus Davenport, Carl Granderson, and Tanoh Kpassagnon are all good run defenders.  However, the inability of the tackles to get inside push lets blockers to seal them off from crashing down on the ball and allows runners to get yards inside of the ends. 
Linebackers Demario Davis, Pete Werner, and Kaden Elliss have been the strongest and most consistent parts of the defense.  Davis leads the team with 89 tackles, including nine for loss.  His elite instincts, physicality, and ferocious sideline-to-sideline pursuit make him one of the league's best all-around defenders. 
Werner was having a magnificent year and leading the NFL in solo tackles before suffering an ankle injury in Week 9.  The injury sidelined him for four games.  He returned last week against Atlanta, but injured a hamstring that puts his status in doubt this week.  Werner expertly sifts through traffic to the ball and has underrated athleticism in the open field. 
Without Werner, fourth-year LB Elliss saw increased reps and took great advantage of the opportunity.  A physical downhill player, Elliss has given a jolt to the entire unit.  In the four games Werner missed, he totaled 40 tackles, including two outings of double-digit stops. 
New Orleans defensive backs haven't swarmed to the ball like we've seen in years past.  The entire unit has struggled with missed tackles and poor angles to the ball.  This is especially true of veteran S Tyrann Mathieu, a disappointing offseason acquisition.
Another offseason pickup, S Marcus Maye, has been in and out of the lineup because of injuries.  He's now dealing with a shoulder injury that's expected to keep him limited in practice this week. 
- 22.4 points per game (13th)
- 149 rushing yards/game (5th)
- 4.7 per rush (11th)
- 18 rushing touchdowns (4th)
- 37.5% 3rd Down Percentage (22nd)
Cleveland has had one of the league's most productive ground games all season.  They have eight outings of over 170 yards rushing and have been held under 100 by just three opponents. 
Fifth-year RB Nick Chubb has been the star of the offense.  Currently third in the league in rushing, Chubb has 1,252 yards and 12 scores while averaging five yards per carry.  Chubb has terrific power and good open field burst, allowing him to be effective inside and outside.  He has six 100-yard outings and four more of at least 70.
While Chubb has carried the load, the Browns have an outstanding pair of backs behind him.
Sixth-year back Kareem Hunt has seen a decrease in reps, but is a former 1,000-yard back capable of starting for most teams.  He has 443 yards and three scores on the ground while adding 28 catches and 182 yards as a receiver.  The Browns don't miss a beat when Hunt is in the backfield. 
With such a talented duo in front of him, there just haven't been any touches for fourth-year RB D'Ernest Johnson.  When he's gotten chances, Johnson has shown a nice combination of speed, power, and balance. 
Quarterback Jacoby Brissett, who started 11 games during Watson's suspension.  He's a rushing threat that the Browns have continued to use in some situations since Watson's return.  Brissett has 241 rushing yards, third on the team, and two scores.  Watson isn't known as a runner, but is still capable of making plays with his legs. 
Cleveland has relied on the run all season.  With frigid temperatures and multiple inches of snow expected on Saturday, that certainly won't change.
New Orleans gave up a season-high 231 yards rushing to the Falcons last week.  Cleveland's physical offensive line will challenge the Saints front through all four quarters, especially along the interior.
Expect New Orleans to bring a safety in the box often, probably Maye. The strategy will give the Saints an extra defender against Cleveland blocking and create more one-on-one matchups along the line of scrimmage.
One of the key matchups will be Davis and the Saints linebackers versus Chubb, particularly in the open field. We will definitely see several bone-jarring collisions in an old-school showdown.
The winner of those matchups will almost certainly determine the victor in what's expected to be a physical battle in sloppy weather. ","Sports Illustrated New Orleans Saints News, Analysis and More","Editorial / opinion, Pete werner, Deshaun watson, Kareem hunt, New orleans saints, New orleans saints news, David onyemata, Saints news, Nick chubb, Kaden elliss, Cameron jordan, Demario davis",Bob rose,"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 19:23:03 GMT",The Saints performance against the run is the most surprisingly disappointing aspect of their game in 2022.

https://www.si.com/nfl/saints/news/saints-place-cesar-ruiz-injured-reserve,"Saints Place Cesar Ruiz on Injured Reserve, Make Several Tuesday Transactions","In a fairly shocking move, the Saints placed starting guard Cesar Ruiz on injured reserve Tuesday.
The Saints placed starting right guard Cesar Ruiz on injured reserve Tuesday, according to the NFL Transaction Report. It effectively ends his season. The news was first reported by ESPN's Field Yates.
Ruiz played in all 55 offensive snaps on Sunday against the Falcons, and was listed on the team's first estimated injury report of the week with a foot injury. Ruiz was playing well this season, being a fairly bright spot along the offensive line. He even shifted to center against the Bucs a couple of weeks ago. As for a replacement, the Saints could look to undrafted rookie Lewis Kidd or Calvin Throckmorton for Saturday's game against the Browns.
New Orleans also made a few other moves, signing linebacker Ty Summers off the Jaguars practice squad, bringing back Nephi Sewell to the practice squad, and terminating the contract of Kenny Young.","Sports Illustrated New Orleans Saints News, Analysis and More","Nfl news, New orleans saints, Saints, Saints news, Nfl, Cesar ruiz, Saints injury update, Nfl week 16, New orleans saints injuries, New orleans saints news, News",John hendrix,"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 23:00:52 GMT","In a fairly shocking move, the Saints placed starting guard Cesar Ruiz on injured reserve Tuesday.",https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNzQ5NTcwMjI3MTg0ODQw/usatsi_19164247_168388561_lowres.jpg
https://www.si.com/nfl/saints/news/saints-tuesday-injury-report-week-16,Saints Tuesday Injury Report - Week 16,"New Orleans didn't practice on Tuesday, but still released an estimated injury report for their Week 16 game at Cleveland. Two major offensive contributors show up on the report.
The New Orleans Saints face the Cleveland Browns in a Christmas Eve showdown on Saturday.  New Orleans also announced plans to travel to Cleveland on Thursday rather than Friday because of a Winter Storm forecast to hit the Great Lakes region. 
The Saints did not practice on Tuesday.  However, the team did put out an estimated injury report based on expected participation. 
Chris Olave, WR (hamstring)
Cesar Ruiz, G (foot)
Pete Werner, LB (hamstring)
Dwayne Washington, RB (illness)
Ryan Ramczyk, RT (rest)
Marcus Maye, S (shoulder)
Adam Trautman, TE (ankle)
Marshon Lattimore, CB (abdomen)
P.J. Williams, S (knee)
Olave and Ruiz are new to the injury report.  Both were injured during Sunday's win over Atlanta, but returned to the game. Ruiz has been the team’s most consistent lineman this season. Olave leads the Saints in receiving with 63 catches for 940 yards. Both have played in every game this season. 
Werner returned to the lineup against the Falcons after missing four games with an ankle injury, but hurt his hamstring during the contest. Kaden Elliss has played extremely well with increased snaps, but Werner's presence would strengthen a run defense that's struggled all year.
Ramczyk would have gotten a customary day of rest.  Lattimore has missed nine straight games.  He's had limited practice participation the last few weeks before being listed inactive at game time.  Given the frigid weather forecast for Saturday, we shouldn't expect him to suit up.  Williams has missed the last two weeks while dealing with a knee injury.  Trautman was injured in the first half against Atlanta, but returned to the lineup. 
The 5-9 Saints need a win over Cleveland to harbor any realistic hopes of an NFC South title. ","Sports Illustrated New Orleans Saints News, Analysis and More","Adam trautman, New orleans saints, Saints injury report, Saints news, New orleans saints news, News, Marshon lattimore, Chris olave, Cesar ruiz, Pete werner",Bob rose,"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 22:33:11 GMT","New Orleans didn't practice on Tuesday, but still released an estimated injury report for their Week 16 game at Cleveland.
