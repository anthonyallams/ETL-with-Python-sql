https://www.si.com/college/unc/basketball/north-carolina-answers-the-call-in-win-over-michigan,North Carolina answers the call in win over Michigan,"The Tar Heels fought back in a gritty 80-76 win over the Michigan Wolverines.
At the 6:53 mark of the first half, North Carolina trailed Michigan 26-22 when a a foul on Hunter Dickinson ignited the Tar Heels on the floor and in the stands. Dickinson, who had previously connected with an elbow to the face of Armando Bacot, proceeded to stand over guard Caleb Love and give him a light kick while on the ground.
This kindled a fire inside the North Carolina coaching staff and players, as the Tar Heels finished the half on a 19-8 run to take a 41-34 lead.
Despite the Wolverines cutting the advantage to as little as two points in the final minute, North Carolina closed out the Big Ten opponent for an 80-76 victory.
R. J Davis connected on a floater off the glass with 52 seconds remaining and Love finished a perfect 4-for-4 from the line in the final minute to seal the fourth straight win for the Tar Heels.
In a game that had a March atmosphere and intensity, Hubert Davis' squad answered the call exactly how the did on Saturday: with heart and grit. 
Continuing their improved offensive play, they executed through Armando Bacot, who finished with a game-high 26 points on 11-of-15 shooting.
Facing off against one of the presumed best big men in the country, Bacot dominated the matchup and helped the North Carolina offense play inside-out, shooting 35 percent from three-point range.
In addition to Bacot, Love and Davis combined for 37 points and showed up when the Tar Heels needed it most. 
Although he committed five turnovers, the playmaking ability and selflessness of Love was a major factor in the victory. Over his last three games, he has amassed 17 assists, helping transform the offense in Chapel Hill.
While the box score may not indicate it, the most impactful player along with Bacot was Leaky Black. The fifth-year graduate student fell one point shy of his first career double-double with nine points and ten rebounds.
On the defensive end, he once again showcased why he is among the best defenders in all of college basketball. 
Black chased down Michigan's Dug McDaniel late in the second half, blocking his shot attempt and subsequently throwing the ball off his legs out of bounds to regain possession.
With a six point lead, Pete Nance converted an and-one opportunity on the following possession to extend the lead and unofficially seal the game.
At 9-4, North Carolina has put together back-to-back resume-boosting wins to get their season back on track.
The preseason No. 1 team in the country looks like they deserve to be ranked once again and they appear to be primed to crack the top-25 come Monday.
A well-deserved break awaits before returning to ACC play, as the Tar Heels will head to Pittsburgh on Dec. 30th for a date with the Panthers. ","Sports Illustrated North Carolina Tarheels News, Analysis and More","Leaky black, Basketball, North carolina, Rj davis, Caleb love, Hubert davis, North carolina basketball, North carolina tar heels, Armando bacot, North carolina tar heel basketball, Unc basketball",Bryant baucom,"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 22:12:36 GMT",The Tar Heels fought back in a gritty 80-76 win over the Michigan Wolverines.,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NjMyMzc2Nzg0MjAwODY2/usatsi_19667186.jpg

Devontez Walker, one of the most dynamic and highly-coveted receivers in the transfer portal, announced his commitment to North Carolina on Wednesday.
The Kent State transfer had a breakout season in the MAC, hauling in 58 passes for 921 yards and 11 touchdowns.
Walker eclipsed the 100-yard mark on four separate occasions, including a seven catch, 106-yard, one touchdown performance against the No. 1 ranked Georgia Bulldogs. 
Two weeks later against Miami of Ohio, he set season-highs for receptions and receiving yards, catching 11 passes for 159 yards and two touchdowns. His production earned himself All-MAC First Team honors.
Walker spent two seasons with the Golden Flashes, totaling 63 receptions for 1045 yards and 12 touchdowns.
As a member of the class of 2020, Walker committed to and enrolled at North Carolina Central. He transferred to Kent State after the cancellation of the 2020 season in Durham.
He becomes the sixth transfer portal pledge for the Tar Heels and will catch passes from Heisman hopeful Drake Maye in 2023.

https://www.si.com/college/unc/football/north-carolina-continues-success-in-the-transfer-portal,North Carolina continues success in the transfer portal,"After losing six defensive backs and one kicker to the transfer portal, the Tar Heels have begun to strengthen their roster for the 2023 season.
For the second time in as many days, North Carolina received two commitments via the transfer portal on Monday.
The Tar Heels continued their success by adding graduate transfer and defensive back Derrik Allen and former Cincinnati kicker Ryan Coe.
Following stints at both Notre Dame and Georgia Tech, defensive back Derrik Allen will join his brother, Marcus, in the Tar Heel secondary, as he committed to North Carolina.
Allen, who spent the last three seasons with the Yellow Jackets, appeared in 31 career games in Atlanta, recording 46 tackles and one interception.
In Georgia Tech's 21-17 upset win in Chapel Hill, he tallied three tackles. 
The former four-star recruit will have one season of eligibility remaining and is the second defensive back commit for UNC from the transfer portal this cycle.
On special teams, Coe, a former Bearcat, will compete with Noah Burnette for the starting job at plackicker and on kickoffs.
In one season with the Cincinnati, Coe was successful on 19-of-23 field goal attempts and 44-of-44 on extra points. He recorded 45 touchbacks en route to a Second Team All-AAC selection.
Prior to his stint in the Queen City, Coe spent three seasons in the Colonial Athletic Association with Delaware. He was 26-of-34 on field goal attempts, connected on two 50-plus yard kicks, and was a two-time All-CAA selection.
Coe visited both Chapel Hill and Wisconsin, who recently hired Bearcat head Coach Luke Fickell, before making his decision.
In total, North Carolina has received four commitments from the transfer portal as they look to build their secondary, bolster their wide receiver room, and strengthen an already stout offensive line.

https://www.si.com/college/unc/football/north-carolina-lands-pair-of-transfers-for-2023,North Carolina lands pair of transfers for 2023,"The Tar Heels will welcome transfers on both sides of the ball, as they improve the secondary and the offensive line.
After hosting official visitors from the transfer portal over the past two weeks, North Carolina gained the commitment of two portal entrants on Sunday.
Coastal Carolina center Willie Lampkin and East Tennessee State cornerback Alijah Huzzie both announced their decision to transfer to Chapel Hill, providing depth on both sides of the ball.
Lampkin spent three seasons with the Chanticleers, earning the Sun Belt Offensive Lineman of the Year award this past season. He appeared in 37 games in Conway, leading to three All-Sun Belt selections.
The Lakeland, Florida native transitioned from guard to center before the 2022 season, giving him the ability to rotate along the Tar Heel offensive line.
Lampkin was a former three-star recruit in the class of 2020.
As starting center Corey Gaynor awaits the decision on his appeal for an extra season of eligibility, Lampkin could replace the Miami transfer right away or join him on the line at guard.
On the defensive side of the ball, East Tennessee State transfer and cornerback Alijah Huzzie will join the secondary in Chapel Hill after three seasons with the Buccaneers.
Huzzie, who started all 11 games in 2022, finished the season with 59 tackles, 16 pass breakups, and six interceptions. He ranked second in the country in interceptions and was a First Team All-SoCon selection. 
In addition to impressing in the secondary, he was the primary punt returner, amassing 138 return yards on nine punts.
The addition of Huzzie will provide some much needed stability for a position group that lost six members to the transfer portal. 
With two commitments and a plethora of visitors, both on offense and defense, North Carolina will look to bolster their wide receiver corps and create a strong secondary through the portal.

https://www.si.com/college/unc/basketball/what-we-know-about-unc-after-comeback-win-over-no-23-ohio-state,What we know about UNC after comeback win over No. 23 Ohio State,"A look into where the Tar Heels' identity stands after beating its first ranked opponent in a comeback win.
Beating its first ranked opponent in a dramatic fashion at Madison Square Garden of all stages, UNC provided some more insight about its identity in a 89-84 comeback win over No. 23 Ohio State. 
UNC found itself down as much as 14 points in the first half, but it slowly chipped down the deficit, tying the game at 72 with just over two minutes to go. The two teams went back and forth down the stretch until the game fell into the hands of Pete Nance, who saved the Tar Heels from another loss by hitting a turnaround jumper to send the game into overtime. 
The Tar Heels closed out the win in the extra period, moving to 8-4 on the season and securing their first Quad 1 victory. All year, this team couldn't win games against quality opponents, especially when it came down to the last few possessions. With the schedule becoming more challenging as ACC play approaches, there was concern about how UNC could salvage the season before March, but the win over the Buckeyes indicated this team is headed in the right direction with a very long way to go. 
In the Tar Heels' shaky wins and disappointing losses this season, the pressing issues have been on offense, starting with poor ball movement. 
UNC played a lot of selfish basketball early on, struggling to rack up assists and get open looks due to a lack of passing. 
It hit rock bottom after the loss to Indiana when the Tar Heels only recorded five assists. However, the ball movement has improved since then. 
It made a huge jump against The Citadel when UNC constantly made the right pass for the right shot in one of its best offensive performances of the season. The Tar Heels accumulated as season-high 24 assists in the win. 
Against Ohio State, UNC eclipsed 20 assists for the second time in a row, showing some consistency in its offensive approach. All afternoon, Caleb Love found Armando Bacot at the rim for easy buckets as he recorded a season-high seven assists for himself. 
Doing this against a quality opponent is a good sign for the Tar Heels as they appear to finally understand the importance of getting the whole team involved. Three players finished the game with over 20 points for the first time this year, which included Bacot with 28, Love with 22 and RJ Davis with 21. 
Despite that improvement, UNC is far from where it wants to be shooting-wise. It's apparent from the Ohio State game that the team needs to significantly improve in shot selection and three-point shooting. 
Shot selection has been an issue all year with players settling for ill-advised threes or highly contested shots. It almost cost the Tar Heels the game when a missed three by Leaky Black allowed the Buckeyes to take the lead in the next possession with just 31 seconds left in regulation. 
The early deficit can be attributed to poor shot selection as well. UNC consistently missed threes throughout the game yet went on stretches where it kept shooting from deep instead of finding the best shot on the inside.  
As far as three-point shooting, the Tar Heels shot an abysmal 21.4 percent on Saturday. Because shooting from beyond the arc has been such a weakness, that is only their fourth-worst three-point percentage all season. 
The three-point numbers have been disappointing this year, considering there's multiple players on the team that have proven to be pretty good from deep. Although Nance came up big with the heroics at the end of regulation, he missed all six of his attempts from deep. 
Plus, failing to hit threes hurts more when UNC struggles to defend them. Ohio State became the Tar Heels' ninth opponent to out shoot them from deep, hitting 37.5 percent of its attempts. 
UNC should feel good about this win, overcoming its own offensive deficiencies to come out on top against a ranked opponent. Once more improvements are made to become more consistent from deep and better with offensive decision making, this team can play its way back into the top-25 and build momentum through ACC play starting on Dec. 30. ","Sports Illustrated North Carolina Tarheels News, Analysis and More",Basketball,Asheebo rojas,"Sun, 18 Dec 2022 03:43:23 GMT",A look into where the Tar Heels' identity stands after beating its first ranked opponent in a comeback win.,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NTE4ODQ0NjkyMjQzODQz/usatsi_19641998.jpg
https://www.si.com/college/unc/basketball/unc-vs-ohio-state-preview,UNC vs Ohio State Preview,"The Tar Heels will face-off against the Buckeyes looking for their first ranked win of the season.
After returning to the win column with two consecutive victories on their home floor, North Carolina will once again hit the road on Saturday, facing off against No. 23 Ohio State in the CBS Sports Classic.
The Buckeyes, who enter the contest at 7-2, have won their last two contests after falling to Duke in the ACC/Big Ten Challenge. Their last game, which was on Dec. 8th, featured a controversial buzzer beater, where Tanner Holden appeared to step out of bounds before nailing a three-point attempt for the 67-66 win.
Forwards Zed Key (14.3 points) and Brice Sensabaugh (14.1 points) are the two leading scorers for Chris Holtmann's squad that shoots 37 percent from three and 77.5 percent from the charity stripe.
Key also averages a team-high 8.7 rebounds, as Ohio State ranks eighth in the country with a plus-10 rebounding margin over their opponents. 
Guard Isaac Likelele sits second on the roster with 6.3 rebounds per game and leads the way with a team-high 3.1 assists.
While Key is the clear star for the Buckeyes, their production is spread out across a nine-man rotation. Four players score in double figures, six shoot 45 percent from the field or better, and six pull down three or more rebounds.
In North Carolina's 100-67 victory over The Citadel on Tuesday, they put together a complete performance and looked like a team worthy of a top-ten ranking.
The Tar Heels recorded a season-high 24 assists, tallying one on 75 percent of their made baskets.
Armando Bacot set the North Carolina record for 62 games with double-digit rebounds, as he pulled down 11 boards to go along with 14 points.
Caleb Love poured in a game-high 17 points on an efficient 6-of-10 shooting, while Pete Nance scored 16 points on 5-of-6 shooting.
Perhaps the most noticeable difference was the ball movement and spacing on the offensive end. The Tar Heels ran their offense through Bacot and made the extra pass, turning good looks into great looks.
Even more impressive was the North Carolina bench, which recorded a season-high 42 points. Freshman Tyler Nickel led the way with a career-high 16 points.
Fellow freshman Seth Trimble added in five assists and three rebounds with Dontrez Styles tallying nine points and six rebounds in 16 minutes of action.
As they head to Madison Square Garden for the first time in over a decade, a Quad 1 opportunity awaits. With an 0-4 record in the prior chances, a win over Ohio State would go a long way in boosting their resume and getting back inside the top-25.
Using the same offensive approach as Tuesday and cleaning up on the glass will help the Tar Heels extend their winning streak to three games.

https://www.si.com/college/unc/basketball/top-performers-from-the-tar-heels-win-over-usc-upstate,Top performers from the Tar Heels' win over USC-Upstate,"No. 7 UNC rolls to its third straight victory in a 89-47 rout of USC-Upstate.
No. 7 UNC extended its win streak to three with a wire-to-wire  victory over USC-Upstate on Friday night. The team is now 9-1 on the season. 
The Tar Heels jumped out to an early 7-0 lead, but sloppy play brought the Spartans within two just minutes later. After a late first quarter run, UNC took a 13 point lead and never looked back, leading by as much as 32 by the third period. 
Like many of their wins, the Tar Heels' performance entailed a combination of elite offense and defense. The team shot a season-high field-goal percentage of 60.7 and grabbed 13 steals. This is the third time the team made over 50 percent of their shots and recorded over 10 steals this season.
There were some impressive individual performances as well. Three players scored in double-digits for the  time this season as well as a new career high in scoring for one player. Here are the top performers from Friday night's win. 
Deja Kelly
Junior guard Deja Kelly had her most efficient scoring night of the season, putting in 20 points while shooting 8-11 from the floor. 
As expected, Kelly found success in the mid-range game as well as driving to the rim. She attempted, and made, only one three-pointer the whole game. 
This was a much needed bounce-back game for Kelly, who hadn't been shooting well dating back to the Indiana loss. Since that game, she has shot under 30 percent twice and failed to reach 10 points for the first time since opening night in Sunday's game against Wofford. 
Against USC-Upstate, Kelly shot her highest field-goal percentage of the season and second-highest of her career. She now leads UNC in scoring, averaging 15.4 points per game. 
Eva Hodgson
Redshirt senior guard Eva Hodgson had yet another all-around night, carrying significant loads on offense and defense. 
Hodgson was the Tar Heels' second leading scorer on Friday with 16 points. She made seven of her 11 field-goal attempts, including two three-pointers, and pitched in four assists on top of that. 
On the defensive end, she tallied a team-high four steals. This was the second game in a row in which she took the ball away four times. Hodgson is now tied with Destiny Adams for the most steals amongst the Tar Heels this season with 19. 
Paulina Paris 
First-year guard Paulina Paris had a career night in Friday's win. 
She recorded career-highs in points, field-goals made and three-pointers made. Paris finished the game with 15 points on 6-9 shooting, including three made shots from beyond the arc. 
This game can be a confidence booster for the newcomer who hasn't had too good of a year shooting percentage-wise. Although she's been contributing in other ways, especially on defense, Paris hasn't been able to get shots to fall this season, shooting the worst percentage (33.9) amongst Tar Heels that have played over three games. 
Nonetheless, the guard keeps letting it fly, and in her most recent performance, Paris showed just how valuable of a scorer she can be when the shots fall. ","Sports Illustrated North Carolina Tarheels News, Analysis and More",Basketball,Asheebo rojas,"Sat, 17 Dec 2022 18:14:17 GMT",No. 7 UNC rolls to its third straight victory in a 89-47 rout of USC-Upstate.,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NDk2Nzg0Mzk4MDM0MzA3/usatsi_19213697.jpg
https://www.si.com/college/unc/basketball/unc-vs-usc-upstate-preview,UNC vs. USC-Upstate Preview,"UNC looks for three wins in a row before heading to Charlotte for the Jumpman Invitational.
Following the blowout loss to Indiana, UNC has positioned itself back on a winning streak. 
The Tar Heels bounced back with two straight blowout wins over UNC-Wilmington and Wofford, outscoring them by a combined 54 points. They will look to extend the winning streak to three against USC-Upstate on Friday. 
USC-Upstate is led by head coach Jason Williams, who is in his first year with the Spartans after accumulating 171 wins in nine seasons at Belmont Abbey College. 
So far, the Spartans are 3-6 overall and 0-4 on the road. They are averaging 46.1 points per game while their opponents are averaging 61.6. 
Three of those losses have come against high-major opponents, however. USC-Upstate has lost by a combined 134 points to West Virginia, Virginia Tech and Vanderbilt. As of Thursday, the Spartans are on their own two-game winning streak with wins over Morehead State and Montreat College. 
Statistically, the Spartans are at a disadvantage when travelling to play high-major teams, and that will likely continue against UNC. 
When it comes to offensive talent and production, the Tar Heels have the upper hand, considering they have four players averaging over 10 points per game while USC-Upstate only has one. 
USC-Upstate guard Isabella Geraci leads the team in scoring with 10.1 points per game, recently recording a 17-point, 10-rebound double-double against Morehead State on Monday. 
The 5-9 guard is not the most efficient shooter with a 38 percent field-goal percentage, but she can make the three when needed, hitting 41.7 of her attempts from deep. She's also very active on the defensive end with a team-high 19 steals. 
Yet, the Tar Heels' guard depth will be too much to handle. Both Deja Kelly and Kennedy Todd-Williams are averaging 14.9 points per game and Todd-Williams will have a size advantage as well. She and Eva Hodgson have been great on-ball defenders, too, grabbing a combined 26 steals. 
The key for the guards will be to limit turnovers on the offensive end while creating them on the defensive end. USC-Upstate averages 26.9 turnovers per game. 
For the bigs, this game will be about controlling the paint. The Tar Heels will also have bigger bodies under the rim who are also elite defenders. Destiny Adams is eighth in the ACC in total blocks with 13, and Alyssa Ustby isn't far behind with 11. 
USC-Upstate is amongst the lower competition on the Tar Heels' schedule, but that shouldn't be much of a concern for UNC, who has taken care of business in games like these this season. 
Another big win on Friday will give the Tar Heels momentum going into the Jumpman Invitational when the competition will ramp up starting with No. 19 Michigan. ","Sports Illustrated North Carolina Tarheels News, Analysis and More",Basketball,Asheebo rojas,"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 18:27:51 GMT",UNC looks for three wins in a row before heading to Charlotte for the Jumpman Invitational.,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NDc0MDQ3OTE0OTExNDA5/usatsi_19213696-1.jpg
