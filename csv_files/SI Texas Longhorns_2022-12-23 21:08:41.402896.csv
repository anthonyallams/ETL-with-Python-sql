AUSTIN - The Texas Longhorns had arguably the best running back room in the country in 2022, which had far more in it than just superstar Bijan Robinson. 
And on Friday, the Longhorns officially lost a key part of that group, in No. 2 running back, and team leader, Roschon Johnson, who officially opted out of the Alamo Bowl vs. Washington, and declared for the NFL Draft. 
Johnson announced his decision on his Instagram account, in a heartfelt message to Longhorns Nation. 
Dear Longhorn Nation,
First off, I want to thank god, my family, teammates, coaches and friends who have helped me along my journey here at Texas. Coming to the University of Texas was a dream come true and I've experienced so much in my time here.
To each and every single one of my teammates I've played with at texas, thank you. Without you guys, I wouldn't have been able to have any type of success as a player. I've made lifelong bonds and relationships that go beyond the field.
To my coaches, thank you for giving me the opportunity to play at this university. From coach Herman's staff to Coach Sark's staff. I've met so many great people that just so happen to be coaches. Also I'd like to thank my academic advisors and training staff for the support. What you do doesn't go unnoticed.
Lastly to Longhorn Nation, thank you. I want you guys to know I gave this university all of me, even if it wasn't seemingly the most convenient thing to do. I devoted myself in every way possible to get this university back on the pedestal it should be at. Your support did not go unnoticed, and for that I thank you.
With that being said I have decided to declare for the
2023 NFL Draft and will opt out of the Alamo Bowl on December 29th. I am excited to embark on a new chapter in my life and plan on fulfilling a lifelong dream of playing professional football. It's been a hell of a ride, and I thank you all for everything.
Hookem!
Roschon, Johnson
In his final season in Austin, Johnson rushed for 93 carries for 554 yards and five touchdowns in 2022. 
He finishes his career with 2,190 yards and 23 touchdowns on 392 carries.

https://www.si.com/college/texas/news/texas-longhorns-washington-huskies-alamo-bowl-ticket-prices,Ticket Prices for Texas vs. Washington Alamo Bowl,"The Texas Longhorns are preparing to face the Washington Huskies in San Antonio and here's how to go.
The Texas Longhorns are preparing to face the Washington Huskies in the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio. If you don’t already have tickets for the game, then let’s check out what tickets look like for the game.
Tickets for the Alamo Bowl 
The Texas Longhorns won’t have played like running back Bijan Robinson or linebacker DeMarvion Overshown on the field due to declaring for the NFL Draft. Perhaps that’s reflected in ticket prices for the game at SITickets.com. 
As of Thursday evening a fan looking for a ticket in the Alamodome’s upper level in the corner on the Washington side of the field would pay $61 per ticket. Most of the upper-level (300-level seats range up to $130. 
But that’s where choosy fans can get a bit of a bargain. Why spent that on an upper-level seat when you can get a Club seat on the 200 level for the same price ($131 each). In fact, if you want to get a seat on the lower level (100-level) you can spend just one dollar more and get one in Section 120 (corner end zone) for $132.
But, if you just have to sit at the 50-yard-line, you can do so … for $688 on Row 5 on the Washington side. 
If you’re looking for tickets for the Simmons Bank Pre-Game Party, those are going for $70, and post-game field access tickets are going for $47 each.

Merry Flipmas, Texas Longhorns fans.
Texas secured a commitment flip from talented 2023 St. John Bosco (Bellflower, Calif.) receiver DeAndre Moore Jr. on Thursday night.
Moore Jr. had been committed to Louisville since May 31 after previously de-committing from Oklahoma on Jan. 31. Along with the Sooners and Cardinals, The Longhorns jostled Moore Jr. away from elite teams like the Georgia Bulldogs, the Alabama Crimson Tide, LSU Tigers, Tennessee Volunteers and Oregon Ducks. 
He made an official visit to Texas on Nov. 12 and apparently liked what he saw. 
Texas' acquisition of Moore Jr. now gives the Longhorns their 23rd commitment in the class of 2023 and the third receiver, as he'll now be joining DeSoto (TX) pass-catcher Johntay Cook and Aldine Eisenhower (Houston, TX) receiver Ryan Niblett.
Along with these two, he's now a part of an elite recruiting class that features names like Arch Manning, Anthony Hill, Cedric Baxter Jr., Malik Muhammad, and Colton Vasek.
The Longhorns will take the field next on December 29 in San Antonio Against the Washington Huskies.

The Texas Longhorns have boasted some of the best running backs in college football history, from legends such as Earl Campbell and Ricky Williams to recent greats such as Bijan Robinson. 
Robinson, who won the Doak Walker, is off to the NFL after declaring for the draft and forgoing his senior year. Also making his way to the NFL will be Roschon Johnson, which means Texas will need to replace two talented backs next season. 
As it currently stands, the duo of Jonathon Brooks and Jaydon Blue have shown they can hold it down for the Longhorns at the running back position. 
However, the Longhorns added a pair of talented running backs on early signing day in Cedric Baxter and Tre Wisner. Steve Sarkisian believes both backs could earn playing time early on, comparing them to Reggie Bush and LenDale White who played as true freshmen at USC.
“I think freshmen can come in and play the running back position,"" Sarkisian said.  ""You don’t want the same runner every year. We’re always trying to find — if we’re going to take two, how do they balance each other out?”
Baxter has flashed the talent to start from day one, and over his last two seasons recorded 376 carries for 3,093 yards and 41 touchdowns. Not to be left out, Wisner recorded 1,704 rushing yards and 19 touchdowns on 200 carries. 
The two backs offer two different elements, with Baxter sporting a 6-1, 215-pound frame while Wisner comes in at 5-11 and 180 pounds, as the combination of the two offers Steve Sarkisian and his staff the prototypical lightning and thunder backfield duo.
Whether or not one of Baxter or Wisner supplants Brooks or Blue on the depth chart is, of course, yet to be seen. That being said, Texas is in an excellent position in the running back room despite losing two talented backs in Robinson and Johnson.

https://www.si.com/college/texas/recruiting/5-star-safety-peyton-bowen-saga-comes-to-end-with-ou-commitment-longhorns-recruiting-tracker,5-Star Safety Peyton Bowen Saga Comes To End With OU Commitment,"Texas Longhorns Recruiting Tracker: Check back often as we keep you up-to-date on Longhorns news as Texas looks to improve on an already impressive class
DECEMBER 22
The saga of the recruitment for 5-Star safety prospect Peyton Bowen has finally come to an end, with the Guyer (Denton, TX) product finally committing to the Oklahoma Sooners on Thursday. 
Bowen had flipped his commitment from Notre Dame to Oregon on Early Signing Day Wednesday morning, but did not submit his national letter of intent to the Ducks. 
And just one day later, the former Texas target has now flipped from Oregon to Oklahoma, joining his high school teammate, quarterback Jackson Arnold. 
DECEMBER 21
The Texas Longhorns hoped to flip and sign one of the top receivers in the 2023 class on Wednesday in Bellflower (CA) St. John Bosco Prep star, DeAndre Moore. 
However, Moore was reportedly absent from the signing ceremony, and will is not expected to sign anywhere on Wednesday.
DECEMBER 19
If there was any question remaining about the Texas Longhorns holding on to 2023 No. 1 overall running back Cedric Baxter, they are now answered, with Baxter reaffirming his commitment and announcing that he will be signing with UT on Wednesday at noon.
This fall, Baxter debuted as the top running back in the 2023 SI99 and the number 21 player overall.
He chose Texas over Texas A&M, Florida, and Miami, and despite late pushes from those programs, as well as Florida State, Baxter remains a Longhorn.
Baxter possesses day-one starting ability at the next level, and will compete for the job next year with current Texas running backs Jonathon Brooks and Jaydon Blue.
Over the last two seasons at Edgewater, Baxter had 376 carries for 3.093 yards and 41 touchdowns.
DECEMBER 17
One of the most coveted young quarterback recruits in the country is back on the market. 
Accorrding to various reports Saturday morning, Dylan Raiola backed off of his verbal commitment to Ryan Day and the Ohio State Buckeyes. Before that point, the Chandler (Ariz.) High School star racked up more than two-dozen scholarship offers, including from Texas. 
The news came after considerable turnover in college football this fall, including in-state Arizona State hiring Kenny Dillingham as head coach and Nebraska bringing in Matt Rhule from the NFL. Raiola has considerable family ties to the Cornhusker program, where his father Dominic was an All-American center. 
As a junior in 2022, Raiola posted a 22:5 touchdown to interception ratio. He earned his offer from Steve Sarkisian on a visit to Austin in September of 2021.
DECEMBER 16
A former Texas Longhorn verbal commitment has found a new home. 
In-state defensive back standout Jamel Johnson, the Arlington (Texas) Seguin safety who was committed to UT for nearly one year, announced his pledge to TCU on Friday. 
The Horned Frogs, Ole Miss and Arkansas were among the programs most interested in Johnson surrounding the Texas recruitment.  
DECEMBER 15
On Thursday the Longhorns landed a commitment from linebacker Brady Sarkisian out of Corona Del Mar in Newport Beach, California. The linebacker is the son of coach Steve Sarkisian. 
DECEMBER 14
There has been a lot of buzz in and out of Austin surrounding SI99 slot receiver and longtime Longhorns commitment Ryan Niblett. The Houston native took an official visit to the University of Houston over the weekend, creating plenty of angst for UT fans late in the recruiting cycle. 
While the Cougars aren't considered to be on the outside looking in just yet, multiple reports say wide receiver coach Brennan Marion has been key in helping Texas hold off the late flip attempt. Not only has the wide receiver coach worked the phones with the Niblett camp, he stopped by for an in-person session before the UH official took place. 
UH has already flipped one Texas wide receiver commitment in Jonah Wilson, who made the local switch in October. 
DECEMBER 12
Just over one week from the beginning of the Early Signing Period, Texas is in the mix to bolster a top five recruiting class with big names. 
From No. 1 tight end Duce Robinson to California wide receiver Deandre Moore and former Texas A&M linebacker commitment Anthony Hill, UT has a shot to finish the cycle on the highest of notes. 
Arch Manning is pitching in down the stretch, too. 
“We’re working on Deandre Moore from Bosco in California, he’s a good player,” Manning told 247Sports. “We’ve got to make sure everyone stays and signs and I’m working on (five-star tight end) Duce Robinson, he’s a stud, we need him. And obviously (five-star linebacker) Anthony Hill.”
Manning will enroll at UT in January.
DECEMBER 11
The weekend around Texas football recruiting was largely focused on prospects in the state clinching state championship-game births like Johntay Cook and Tre Wisner at DeSoto High School, which upset Denton Guyer and Oklahoma-bound quarterback Jackson Arnold on Friday night. 
Beyond that, it's about visitors to UT, including a unique defensive line target in Justin Benton. The longtime West Virginia commitment from Georgia spent the weekend in Austin and shared pictures from his Texas photo shoot via social media on Saturday. 
Benton, who was named Class 7A-Region 4 Co-Defensive Player of the Year, was offered by UT at the end of October. In early December, Texas defensive line coach Bo Davis went in-home with the interior projection. The visit was then set to Austin, his second trip to a program other than the one he has been committed to. Benton also visited Arkansas for a November official visit. 
West Virginia hosted Benton for an official visit in June, just before he committed to Neal Brown's program. 
DECEMBER 7
Some six weeks after earning a scholarship offer from Texas, the Longhorns have made the next big cut for coveted class of 2024 wide receiver recruit Jordan Anderson. 
The Long Beach (Calif.) Millikan standout has amassed more than two dozen scholarship offers to date, but cut his list to seven programs via social media Wednesday. 
In addition to UT, USC, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Colorado and Michigan made the top group for Anderson. Several of the programs in the Pac-12 footprint, as well as Michigan, have hosted Anderson on campus within the last year or so. 
It appears as if Texas' next step would be to get the top junior on campus. 
DECEMBER 2
December 15 is the date all of college football has long awaited relative to arguably the top available secondary recruit in the country. 
A top five nickel recruit on SI All-American, Arlington (Texas) Martin defensive back Javien Toviano amassed dozens of scholarship offers over the years. He also spent considerable time on the road in 2022, and now he has the verbal commitment date as well as finalists Texas, Texas A&M, LSU, Georgia and Michigan.
Toviano announced the news via social media on Friday evening. 

View the original article to see embedded media.

The Early Signing Period opens up on December 21, the first day class of 2023 prospects can sign a National Letter of Intent for their college of choice.
2. One of the top juniors in the Lone Star State has trimmed his list of scholarship offers and Texas remains in the hunt. 
Payton Pierce, the Lucas (Texas) Lovejoy two-sport star who projects as a premiere linebacker in the 2024 class, announced a top 10 on social media Friday. Along with UT, Texas A&M, Michigan, Oklahoma, Notre Dame, Baylor, Arkansas, TCU, Tennessee and Oklahoma State made the cut. Pierce has a wrestling state championship to his name, too. 
  Texas joined the race for his services back in February. He has since visited Austin several times, including for a home game this fall.
  While a cut to 10 may not seem significant, it's a strong step for the Pierce, who has amassed more than 30 scholarship offers to date. 
NOVEMBER 30
The surprising decision from David Shaw, who stepped down from Stanford over the weekend, continues to reverberate in college football recruiting. 
Many Stanford football commitments are entertaining other scholarship offers while others are new targets of other programs. Add Texas to the list when it comes to Chatsworth (Calif.) Sierra Canyon defensive lineman Cameron Brandt. 
Texas targeted the senior, who registered 61 total tackles and four sacks in 2022, with a new scholarship offer this week via Bo Davis.
The above is also Brandt's pinned Tweet on the social media platform, meaning it is the first post anyone visiting his page would see. 
Texas holds a top five recruiting class on SI All-American, with several targets still to be decided come Early Signing Day and/or beyond. 
NOVEMBER 29
The Texas Longhorns have lost a major commitment, in 2024 wide receiver pledge, Aeryn Hampton. 
Hampton de-committed from the program via Twitter. 
He was one of three commits for the 2024 class for Texas. 
Athlete Hunter Modden and defensive back Jaden Allen still remain firm with the Longhorns 
NOVEMBER 24
Priority Texas Longhorns defensive line target Johnny Bowens announced his commitment to Oregon on Thanksgiving Day, picking the Ducks over the Horns and the Texas A&M Aggies. 
Bowens was originally an Aggies' commitment, before committing earlier this year. 
He is one of the top defensive line recruits in the state of Texas.
NOVEMBER 14
The Texas Longhorns could be on the verge of adding one of the top linebackers in the class of 2023. 
Per On3, the Longhorns are ""in the driver's seat"" when it comes to snagging a commitment from Ryan (Denton, TX) 2023 linebacker Anthony Hill, who decommitted from Texas A&M last week. 
Hill is already out hunting for his collegiate destination, which now appears to favor the Longhorns. He was in Austin Saturday to watch Texas' 17-10 loss to the No. 4 TCU Horned Frogs. Hill was joined by other recruits, most notably 2023 Texas quarterback commit Arch Manning. 
The full list of visitors can be viewed here.
NOVEMBER 11
As if this Saturday's matchup vs. No. 4 TCU wasn't big enough already, the No. 18 Texas Longhorns are set to host a star-studded list of visitors this weekend. 
And now, according to reports, it appears Texas is pulling out the big gun to help make their case this weekend, with star QB commit Arch Manning expected to make his way to Austin as well. 
Since his commitment, Manning has long been one of the Horns' top recruiters, and with so many top recruits heading to the 40 Acres, Manning's presence will be crucial to Steve Sarkisian and the Longhorns selling their vision for the program. 
You can view the full list of visitors, which includes star Denton Ryan linebacker Anthony Hill, and defensive back Javien Toviano, here. 
NOVEMBER 9
The Texas vs. TCU matchup will bring star recruits out to Austin all weekend long and while most of the focus is with the class of 2023, the 2024 group will be able to hold its end of the blue-chip spectrum as well. 
One of the headliners among top juniors expected confirmed his plans to be back at UT Wednesday in Colin Simmons, he posted on social media.
Simmons, a star for Duncanville (Texas) High School, holds more than 40 scholarship offers to his name at 6-foot-3, 225 pounds. 
Texas has been in this race for more than a year, extending an offer the junior's way last September. He has since been on campus multiple times. Georgia, Alabama, Ohio State, Texas A&M, LSU and scores of other programs are involved for Simmons at this time. 
NOVEMBER 7
One of Texas' top overall targets is back on the market. 
Shockwaves through college football were felt on Monday afternoon when Anthony Hill announced he was backing off of his commitment to Texas A&M. The Denton (Texas) Ryan linebacker, ranked top 50 in the SI99, had been on board with Jimbo Fisher's program since late July after a round of official visits. 
One of those trips, naturally, was to Texas during the weekend of June 24. Each of Hill's five allotted official visit trips has already been taken, with A&M, Alabama, Oklahoma and USC also receiving trips from him.
In a report from On3, Hill said he doesn't plan on making another decision until December. 247Sports reports Hill making plans to visit Texas this coming weekend for the TCU showdown. 
NOVEMBER 3
When Texas commitment and SI99 cornerback Malik Muhammad showed up on a Texas A&M visit in October, of course there was worry from the Longhorn side of social media. 
However, according to On3, not much should have been made of the trip. In fact, Muhammad told the outlet of his excitement to enroll at UT in January in addition to getting back to Austin for the TCU game the weekend of November 12. 
Muhammad, ranked as the nation's No. 2 cornerback per SI, is close to several future Longhorns on the commitment list. 
NOVEMBER 2
Texas will have a hat on the table for the top uncommitted offensive lineman in Alabama's ceremony next week. 
Vysen Lang, a 2021 state champion interior offensive line projection from Pike Road (Ala.) High School, announced intentions to come off the board next Monday. In addition to Texas, in-state Auburn and fellow SEC programs Tennessee and LSU are the named finalists. 
Texas is the only program among the final four yet to host Lang for a visit this season. That lack of a visit didn't hurt the Longhorns with the commitment of Payton Kirkland earlier in the 2023 cycle, however. 
OCTOBER 28
One of the top wide receivers in the country will soon see Texas again. 
Austin Westlake star Jaden Greathouse will not only be in town for the Longhorns game against TCU the second week of November, but the trip will be an official visit, according to multiple reports. 
Greathouse remains committed to Notre Dame, where he went public with a pledge back in July, after official visits to South Bend, Oklahoma and South Carolina. It means he has up to two more trips remaining, not including the plans to get back to Austin.  
UT has continued to court Greathouse as it had before the commitment was made, with a need at the wide receiver position. The Longhorns hold commitments from fellow SI99 wide receivers Johntay Cook and Ryan Niblett to date. 
OCTOBER 27 
The Arch Manning era, at least in principle, is just around the corner after all. After some back-and-forth on potentially playing basketball for his senior season, Anwar Richardson reports the Manning camp has opted for early-enrollment at Texas. 
It means Manning will be on campus in Austin come January, instead of later in the year in May or June, when traditional enrollees kick off their collegiate career. 
The elite recruit, pegged top 10 overall by SI.com and No. 1 overall by other outlets, recently broke Peyton and Eli’s career passing records at New Orleans (La.) Isidore Newman High School. 
OCTOBER 26
Texas has long been after one of the top wide receiver classes in the 2023 cycle and one of the best of the bunch is still considering the program despite a commitment elsewhere. 
DeAndre Moore, star at Bellflower (Calif.) St. John Bosco, has ben committed to Louisville since May but Texas and Georgia continue to press for a potential flip. Moore and his family are likely to take an official visit to Austin next month, though the date isn't locked in just yet. 
""I've had a great relationship with Sark (Steve Sarkisian) and Coach (Jeff) Banks since eighth grade when he offered me to Alabama, so I've been knowing him for a while,"" Moore told SI All-American. ""When I visited Texas I got to see the city. I love Austin. Austin is like L.A. away from L.A. really.""
But the similarity to his hometown is just one factor in what's increasingly sounding like the perfect fit in Austin.
""Not to mention Coach (Brennan) Marion. Coach Marion is probably one of the best receiver coaches there is. He's a player's coach really. I know I can go there and he can develop into the best player I can be, so that's really why Texas is so appealing to me."" 
The 6-foot, 185-pound playmaker got to visit Texas during the offseason and reflected on the trip.
""I went out there with my family and I got to really tour the city,"" he said. ""Really spend some time with Coach Marion. Got to pick his brain a little bit. Ask him a few questions about how I can get better and I just loved it really.""
Moore is set to enroll at his program of choice in January. 
OCTOBER 25
UT is still in the mix for one of the nation’s top pass rushers. 
Tausili Akana, a Hawaii native with north of 40 scholarship offers to his name, announced a top 10 on Tuesday morning. In addition to Texas making the cut, Texas A&M, Hawaii, Notre Dame, LSU, Alabama, Utah, Oklahoma, Penn State and Tennessee also made the top group. 
Akana is well-traveled thus far in the recruiting process, originally visiting Austin back in the summer of 2021. He returned to campus as the Longhorns kicked off the season in September, for an official visit. 
LSU and Oklahoma also had Akana on campus for in-season official visits, while Texas A&M is scheduled to receive one in November. 
OCTOBER 16
One of Texas’ top remaining offensive targets will soon be in town. 
Per On3, Duce Robinson will be making an official visit to Austin on November 12 when TCU is in town. The No. 1 tight end in the country, per the SI99, Robinson has been busy on the visit trail since the summer months. USC, Georgia and Alabama have already hosted him for an official visit. 
Robinson recently told Longhorns Country about his interest in Steve Sarkisian’s program, admitting “it would be fun” to link up with Arch Manning at the next level.
OCTOBER 15
Coming off their 49-0 shutout win over the Oklahoma Sooners, the Texas Longhorns are set to host the Iowa State Cyclones in Austin Saturday morning. 
And in town to take in the festivities is Longhorns 2023 Isidore Newman (LA) quarterback commit Arch Manning. Take a look:
Manning is joined by his high school teammate and fellow Texas 2023 commit, tight end Will Randle. 
OCTOBER 12
Texas has one of the top recruiting classes in America for the 2023 cycle, but it has room left for new additions ahead of National Signing Day come December. 
A new name to monitor on that front learned the good news on Tuesday, as Jelani McDonald announced the news of his new Texas football offer on social media. The two-way Waco (Texas) Connally star, who also plays basketball, has been a verbal commitment to Oklahoma State football since July 1. 
Even before the offer news came down, the 6-foot-2, 190-pound prospect had been alluding to taking a visit to Austin relatively soon. Earlier in the week, On3 reported he will likely visit this weekend with Iowa State in town.  
Many top Texas commitments, including Arch Manning, are expected back in Austin for the Big 12 matchup, so tracking McDonald is worth some attention moving forward.
OCTOBER 11
There was no shortage of reaction from the college football world following Texas' statement win over Oklahoma on Saturday. 
From commentators to coaches, fans and of course recruits -- plenty was said. 
For Texas commitment Cedric Baxter, the top back in the nation in the SI99 rankings, it was more proof of concept in how Steve Sarkisian utilized running backs in the win. 
""I think the way they just used the backs speaks for itself and why I committed there,"" Baxter told SBLive.
Star back Bijan Robinson rushed for 130 yards and a pair of scores while reserves Roschon Johnson and Keilan Robinson each averaged better than 6 yards per carry as well. The trio added six catches for 79 yards and a score (Robinson) in the win, too. 
OCTOBER 4
Arch Manning will be back in Austin this month. 
The elite recruit, who just broke his uncle's passing records at Isidore Newman High School in New Orleans, will take an unofficial visit to campus the weekend of October 15 when Iowa State is in town. The news was first reported by Inside Texas.
Manning, who committed to Texas and spurred the nation's hottest recruiting run in June, has led Newman to a 4-1 record thus far in 2022. The quarterback has started on varsity since his freshman season in 2019.
Texas holds a top-five consensus recruiting class of 2023 to date.
OCTOBER 3
Yet another top commitment for the Longhorns will take a visit to the Alabama Crimson Tide, in New Iberia (LA) safety Derek Williams, according to a report from On3's Sam Spiegelman.
The visit to Tuscaloosa will be an unofficial one for Williams. 
“This visit does loom large,” Spiegelman said. “Pete Golding is leading the recruitment for Derek Williams. Pete Golding is you know, he signed a player from New Iberia Westgate last year from Danny Lewis, who was wanted by LSU and Florida. He’s been a the lead guy and Derek’s recruitment for several years so I think that this visit has been a long time coming. Along with Alabama, LSU, Texas A&M, Miami are all still shooting their shot with Derek Williams.""
Williams currently sits as the No. 2 safety and the No. 32 overall player in the 2023 SI99.

According to a report, Longhorns defensive back commitment Malik Muhammad will take an official visit to Tuscaloosa for the Crimson Tide's matchup against Mississippi State.
It will be the fourth visit for Muhammad to Tuscaloosa. 
He will also take a visit to Texas A&M on October 29 against Ole Miss. Muhammad's high school teammate, Jayvon Thomas, is currently committed to the Aggies.
Muhammad originally committed to the Longhorns in July of this past summer. 
SEPTEMBER 21
In the wake of their loss of Jalen Hale to Alabama on Wednesday, the Texas Longhorns are set to receive an official visit from Louisville wide receiver commit DeAndre Moore of St. John Bosco (Bellflower, CA), per reports.
Moore de-committed from Oklahoma in January before committing to Louisville on May 31.
Moore has visited Texas before, most recently in the spring of this year. 
According to the report, Moore will visit for one of the Longhorns' two home games in in November.
SEPTEMBER 20
The Texas Longhorns will hope to continue their recruiting momentum on Wednesday, September 21, with the announcement of wide receiver commitment Jalen Hale.
Hale will make his announcement at 12:30 pm live on the Longview Gameday Facebook and Youtube pages, and will be deciding between the Longhorns, Alabama Crimson Tide, and Georgia Bulldogs.
Hale is a fan of both Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers, and incoming commit Arch Manning, which could give the Horns and Edge.
""It definitely helps Texas that Quinn Ewers is on campus because he can spin it,"" Hale told 247 Sports. ""After Quinn, my QB would be Arch Manning so that's another thing that I look into.""
SEPTEMBER 16
The Longhorns are set to host three elite visitors for their matchup vs. the UTSA Road Runners on Saturday, including two current commits in safety Derek Williams and running back Cedric Baxter. 
2024 recruit Jordon Johnson-Rubell will also make the trip to Austin. 
One of the top safety recruits in the 2024 class, Johnson-Rubell currently holds offers from Texas, Oklahoma, Oregon, TCU, and Texas A&M among others. 
SEPTEMBER 8
Texas is set to receive a major visitor this weekend when Phoenix (Ariz.) Pinnacle SI99 tight end Duce Robinson heads to the 40 Acres for the Longhorns matchup against the Alabama Crimson Tide. 
""I’m going to take my official for the Texas-Bama game,"" Robinson told Longhorns Country. ""I’m really looking forward to it. Me and coach (Jeff) Banks have been talking for a while. I visited up there last year at the end of July, and I really enjoyed my time there.""
Robinson, who stands 6-6 and weighs in at 225 pounds, could fit a variety of needs for the Longhorns from his tight end spot, whether it be lining up on the line, in the slot, or as an outside receiver in the red zone. 
And as evidenced by his 2021 season, in which he caught 60 passes for 972 yards and eight touchdowns, while also taking snaps as a rusher and even a quarterback at times, he could handle the load.
SEPTEMBER 2
One of Texas' top remaining football targets, Longview (Texas) High School wide receiver Jalen Hale, is closing in on a verbal commitment. 
The SI99 prospect, who says he is down to Texas, Texas A&M, Alabama and Georgia, may be thinking about cutting the list ahead of the decision -- at least privately. 
On3's Chad Simmons reports two teams emerging at the forefront of the race, including the next two he is set to visit in Alabama and Texas. Hale will be in Tuscaloosa this weekend and then will see the Longhorns host the Crimson Tide in Austin on September 10. 
Hale is planning on revealing his college commitment on September 21.

https://www.si.com/college/texas/football/longhorns-liona-lefau-impact-texas,Steve Sarkisian Emphasizes Impact of New Longhorns'  LB Liona Lefau,"LB Liona Lefau proves that the brand of Texas means something from coast to coast.
Coming into the 2022 season, the linebacker position was a major area of need for the Texas Longhorns. After early signing day, though, that will not be the case moving forward. 
Linebacker Liona Lefau, out of Kahuku, HI, is one of three talented linebacker recruits in Texas' 2023 class. He joins Anthony Hill and S'Maje Burrell and was the second linebacker to commit in the 2023 class following Burrell. 
Head coach Steve Sarkisian had high praise of Lefau during his press conference. Sarkisian discussed the impact Lefau had on his community and how he made a difference on his island. 
“I see the impact that he has on his community,” Sarkisian said. “The leader that he is… shows what we are building here.""
What makes Lefau stand out more than just his on-field talent is the person that he is. Sarkisian emphasized how important it is to have great kids who have character in order to build a winning program.
As a junior, Lefau saw action on both sides of the ball. He recorded 8.5 total tackles and three interceptions while serving as the lead tight end for his school and recording 13 receptions for 225 yards and six touchdowns in the process. 
 The 2023 class also showcased how the brand of Texas means something and that was evident by the kids Texas got. The Longhorns were able to land recruits from Hawaii, Florida, California, Louisiana, Utah, and New Jersey.
“We got a great player in our opinion the best player in the state of Hawaii,” Sarkisian said. “Someone that we are fired up to have on board for us.”
Lefau addresses the needs that the Longhorns had at the linebacker position. His sense of community, work ethic, and perseverance likely will serve him well on the 40 acres. Texas needed talented linebackers in the 2023 class and Lefau fits that bill as he will be expected to make an immediate impact with the Texas Longhorns.
The Linebacker position was a critical need for Texas in the 2023 class and Lefau is sure to not disappoint.

https://www.si.com/college/texas/football/texas-longhorns-arch-manning-steve-sarkisian-early-signing-day-impact-commitment-big-12,Longhorns' Steve Sarkisian Details Recruiting Impact Arch Manning Had on Texas,"Arch Manning's pledge to the Texas Longhorns caused a colossal domino effect this past summer, as a slew of other recruits began to follow suit to Austin.
When Arch Manning announced his commitment to the Texas Longhorns in June, the college football recruiting landscape flipped on its head. 
Manning's pledge to Texas caused a colossal domino effect, as a slew of other recruits began to follow suit to Austin. It was a pattern of good fortunate that Longhorns coach Steve Sarkisian clearly recognized, and he didn't hesitate to admit it on Wednesday after Texas officially signed Manning and others for Early Signing Day. 
""I think there was a direct impact on the rest of the class,"" Sarkisian said. ""I think there was a lot of players in this class that thought 'Man if the No. 1 in the country is going to Texas and believes in what they're doing, that's a pretty good destination for me too.""
Manning's commitment was a bit out of nowhere, as it came in the middle of the summer as the Longhorns were beginning prep for the 2022 season. But whether Manning committed in eighth grade or waited all the way up until National Signing Day, it was obviously a pledge Sarkisian and company were stoked about. 
“When he committed to us, it was actually a little earlier than maybe we were anticipating in the process in the summer,"" Sarkisian said with a smile. ""But we took it, we were excited about it.”
While Manning could've chosen to follow in the footsteps of his legendary uncles Peyton and Eli by going to the traditional SEC teams right away rather than wait for Texas to make that jump, he decided to bet on Sarkisian, who, in some ways, is a near-perfect fit for Manning due to his experience at coaching and playing the quarterback position.
This has made his evaluation of Manning -- a process now nearly four years in the making -- more seamless as the two begin to get to work this offseason.
“I think he’s extremely gifted,"" Sarkisian said. ""He’s got all the attributes needed to be a really good quarterback. He’s 6-4, 225 (pounds). He’s got a great arm, he’s a good athlete. He’s got really good fundamentals. There’s not a throw he can’t make, the off-platform throws.""
While there's future-focused hype surrounding the Longhorns following an exciting Early Signing Day, Sarkisian and the rest of the team will look to bid this year's squad a pleasant farewell by closing out the season with a win over the No. 12 Washington Huskies at the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio on Thursday, Dec. 29. 
After that, it's ""All Gas, No Brakes"" toward what should be an exciting offseason.

AUSTIN - The Texas Longhorns finished the 2023 Early Signing period with heaps of momentum. 
Not only did they lock up the most hyped recruit in the modern era in quarterback Arch Manning, but they also inked No. 1 running back Cedric Baxter, No. 1 linebacker Anthony Hill, No. 2 corner Malik Muhammad, No. 2 safety Derek Williams, and No. 2 slot receiver Johntay Cook, all before noon. 
Not to mention Steve Sarkisian got an early Christmas present when elite Utah pass rusher Tausili Akana committed to the Horns over Oklahoma.
Throw that on top of the signatures of SI99 wide receiver Ryan Niblett, and another impressive haul of players in the trenches on both sides of the ball, and 2023 was once again a banner day for Sarkisian and company.
The Longhorns' day was so good, in fact, that they finished the Early Signing Period with Sports Illustrated's No. 3 overall class, just behind the defending national champion Georiga Bulldogs, and a historic Alabama Crimson Tide class at No. 1. 
In all, the Longhorns finished with nine recruits in the 2023 SI99, tying for the second most with Georgia behind Alabama's 12.
Here is what Sports Illustrated's John Garcia had to say about the Longhorns class:
The Longhorns had another strong day on the trail, officially inking many commitments that were contested late like Johntay Cook, Cedric Baxter, Sydir Mitchell, Derek Williams and Malik Muhammad, but it also pulled off another pass-rushing upset against rival Oklahoma in Tausili Akana. Officially wrapping up the Arch Manning recruitment, beyond any doubt, counts for an extra oomph as well.
Now, the Longhorns will turn their attention to wrapping up a few major loose ends that are still left on the board heading into the February signing period, as they work to complete the flip of DeAndre Moore from Louisville, and continue the chase for other talented players such as tight end Duce Robinson, wide receiver Ja'Kobi Lane, linebacker Jelani McDonald, defensive back Trey Scott, and others.

https://www.si.com/college/texas/mens-basketball/texas-longhorns-basketball-dominate-louisiana-ragin-cajuns,No. 7 Longhorns Basketball Dominate Louisiana,"The Longhorns moved to 3-0 under interim head coach Rodney Terry on Wednesday night
AUSTIN - While Early Signing Day took most of the Texas Longhorns headlines on Wednesday, there was also a basketball game to be played, with the No. 7 Horns taking on the Louisiana Ragin Cajuns at the Moody Center.
And once again, despite not having head coach Chris Beard available, the Longhorns took care of business, winning in blowout fashion 100-72, moving to 3-0 under interim coach Rodney Terry, and 10-1 on the season.
The Horns were led offensively by freshman phenom Arterio Morris, who scored a career-high 25 points on 9 of 11 shooting, a hit 5 of 7 threes in 17 minutes.
Texas also got a big night from the duo of Timmy Allen and Marcus Carr, who poured in 17 points each. Allen also added six rebounds, three assists and two blocks, while Carr dished out four assists of his own. 
As a team, Texas shot 58 percent from the floor and 54 percent from three, and were an efficient 16 of 17 from the charity stripe.
Following the win, the Longhorns will have one more tune-up ahead of conference play against Texas A&M Commerce at the Moody Center in Austin. 
Then, they begin Big 12 play with a trip to Norman to take on the Oklahoma Sooners on New Year's Eve.

The No. 7 ranked Texas Longhorns welcome the Lousiana Rajin Cajuns to Austin Wednesday evening. Texas enters the contest at 9-1 having won three in a row. 
New Interim head coach Rodney Terry is 2-0 since taking over the Longhorns with wins over Rice and Stanford. On Sunday Texas survived against Stanford thanks to an offensive explosion in the second half led by guard Marcus Carr.
Tonight’s game is more tricky than it seems on the surface. Louisiana comes into this matchup with an impressive record of 10-1. The Cajuns have already beaten quality opponents in Harvard, East Tennessee State, and SMU. The game is played a few days before Christmas is another challenge. Yesterday in college basketball seven programs lost “buy games”. 
Against Louisiana, Texas will need its guards to lead. Guards Carr, Tyrese Hunter, and Sir’ Jabari Rice all lead the Longhorns averaging over double-digit points a game. In the 72-62 victory over Stanford Sunday Marcus Carr shined with 17 points. Forward Timmy Allen also had another solid performance scoring 15 points and grabbing four rebounds.
Leading the way for the Rajin Cajuns is forward Jordan Brown. He leads the team in scoring averaging 19.6 points per game. Louisiana also has two other scorers averaging over double figures in Forward Terrence Lewis II and guard Greg Williams Jr. The Longhorns will have their hands full tonight going up against one of the highest-scoring offenses in all of college basketball. Louisiana ranks tied for 12th in the country averaging 84.5 points per game.
As most non-conference plays are beginning to wrap up, the Longhorns have their sights set on Big 12 play. The conference is extremely strong this season with all ten teams being projected in the field by bracketologist Joe Lunardi yesterday. Joining Texas in the rankings are No. 4 Kansas, No. 12 Baylor, and No. 20 TCU. Texas will open up Big 12 play on New Year's Eve against Oklahoma in Norman.
