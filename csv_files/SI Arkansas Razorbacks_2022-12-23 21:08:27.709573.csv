https://www.si.com/college/arkansas/hogs-mens-basketball/hogs-in-good-shape-heading-into-sec-play,Quit Worrying Now Hog Fans ... You Don't Need ‘What-If’,"Razorbacks have found roles and may be in best shape headed to SEC play in years.
FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — Arkansas fans have always loved to play the ""what if"" game.
It's usually coming up with excuses for failures of the past.
Even if they hoist the national championship trophy in April, the ""what if"" will still be where this Razorback basketball team would have ranked among the all-time greats.
There's always something. Thank goodness.

Now we come to less than a week before conference play opens on Wednesday night in Baton Rouge against and LSU team that is 11-1 and probably hasn't played a schedule on par with the Hogs.
Comparing non-conference schedule is something to leave for the nerds with nothing better to do. Hogs coach Eric Musselman has done his usual thing of getting a team ready for March.
As we've said repeatedly, it means absolutely nothing in March how you beat a lower-caliber opponent in November.
With one of the best pure shooters in Trevon Brazile going down with a season-ending knee injury and Nick Smith having a stumbling start trying to get a stubborn knee injury in shape for conference play, some lost hope.
Instead, they may have found some of those other hot-shot freshmen can play pretty well, too.

Point Guard Anthony Black
The freshman from Duncanville, Texas, has already become the most unique point guard in the Hogs' long history going back to Ron Brewer (the old guy in my age group) back in the 1970's.
Black just might be the best ever at that position for Arkansas.
If he can figure out how to dunk consistently, he would be even better.
Black ranks first on the team in three-pointers made (13), assists (44), steals (22) and defensive rebounds (46), and he is tied for the team lead in total rebounds (59). He is second among active players in scoring (12.6) and total minutes played (399), and third in blocks (7).
Without Brazile, his rebounding inside where the 6-7 guard with the flying hair can go has been huge. His inconsistency with put-backs and break-away dunks and layups will get better, but he is proving to be a nightmare for other teams to match up against.

Davonte Davis Playing More of Sutton-Style Role
Former coach Eddie Sutton took the Hogs to their first Final Four appearance in 33 years in 1978 with Sidney Moncrief showing why he would become one of the best defensive players in NBA history.
Davonte Davis is developing into a role very similar to that.
Musselman has described him lately as one of the best on-ball defenders in the nation.
""He knows when to gamble, he knows when not to gamble,"" Muss said. ""He puts absolutely immense pressure on the basketball. His defensive tenacity kind of fuels our transition offense a lot of the time.""
Devo wandered around earlier in the year trying to find his role, but now the junior from Jacksonville has appeared to find it ... and he's embracing it.

Kamani Johnson Has Literally Flown Under Radar
The grad transfer from Little Rock does a lot of little things that add up to quite a bit in the overall analysis.
Against UNC-Asheville's Drew Pemberton on Wednesday night, he got up under him defensively and held him nearly 15 points below his per game average this season.
Johnson is eighth on the team in minutes per game, but leads the offensive rebounding. Maybe no other stat shows when he gets in, he's making the most of his minutes adding that key part and grabbing 10 steals.
It's just another key role Musselman found a way to fill.

Jordan Walsh's Sudden Emergence at Perfect Time
Maybe none of the other highly-touted freshmen on this team looked as uncomfortable as Walsh did on the floor in early games.
That has changed.
Now he's emerged as one of the threats in the last two games against Bradley (18 points) and UNC-Asheville contributing with steals and defense.

Ricky Council IV Probably MVP
Council is a guy who can score just about every way possible.
He finds ways to get the ball in the hole and every team that makes a deep run in March has to have someone like that on the team.
Council was third in the SEC in scoring at 18.3 points per game on 51.6% shooting, good for sixth in the league. He apparently has Musselman's full trust.
He has played a team-high 422 minutes, and the Razorbacks have been 13.9 points better per 100 possessions with him on the floor, per CBB Analytics.

Defense Drives This Team
Musselman has always stressed that stopping people on the other end is needed as much as scoring points.
The Hogs are inside the top 10 nationally in a pair of key defensive categories — turnover percentage and steal percentage.
The Razorbacks have forced a turnover on 25.6% of opponents’ possessions this season, and they have come up with a steal on 14.6% of possessions. Those figures are a big reason why Arkansas is No. 9 in the country in defensive efficiency.
It has made a killing capitalizing on teams' miscues. According to CBB Analytics, the Razorbacks are averaging 23.5 points per game off turnovers.
That mark ranks eighth nationally and places the Hogs in the 98th percentile in Division I.

The Bottom Line Headed to SEC Play
Quit worrying about Smith's sorting out whatever is going on with that knee, but you might not want to pay attention to these wanna-be folks claiming they ""know somebody"" that said he's out for the year.
The guess here is he's gone to the NBA whether he plays another game or not for the Hogs (although I am convinced his competitiveness will get him on the floor at some point in time).
Regardless, this team is in better shape at this point than the previous two Razorback teams.
In case you needed a reminder, those ended up in the Elite Eight and if you get that far you are within a break or two of getting that national championship.
No ""what ifs"" should be necessary.

https://www.si.com/college/arkansas/hogs-football/razorbacks-antonio-grier-travis-williams-auburn-usf-bulls-linebacker-transfer-portal-pittman-sec,"Breaking Down What Arkansas Gets in LB Antonio Greir, Jr.","Newest transfer signee hails from USF, familiar to new Razorback DC Williams
FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. – Arkansas coach Sam Pittman got an early Christmas present with the late addition of South Florida All-AAC linebacker transfer Antonio Grier, Jr. for what will be his sixth season of college football.
A late bloomer out high school, Grier shows he still has room for huge jumps in ability that he is counting on this Razorback coaching staff to draw out.
Grier was the first linebacker defensive coordinator Travis Williams had to scheme against in his debut as part of Gus Malzahn's Golden Knights staff in 2021. A senior at the time, Grier ripped off nine tackles en route to a career best 85 for the season.
This appears to be the first player taken with direct influence from Williams. The new defensive coordinator has seen plenty of tape on him with the Bulls on the schedule twice during his tenure down in Florida.
Grier, who has Grant Morgan levels of on-field experience in terms of games played, lists at 6-1, 223. He will need to put on a little more weight in the form of muscle while maintaining, if not increasing his speed.
Those are things that can be done over the next seven months as part of an SEC strength, conditioning and nutrition program, but it's not something every player is built to do. Mental toughness, drive and discipline will go a long way toward whether Grier becomes the SEC's next defensive breakout star or just another good special teams hand.
The positives that clearly show certain levels of promise from a development standpoint is Grier's straight-line speed, good hands in pass defense and his willingness to wrap up on tackles.
If Arkansas is going to blitz from the linebacker spot, there is little doubt the former Bull can get through the gap quickly to blow things up. 
Also, if the Hogs intend to use linebackers regularly in coverage over the middle, Grier shows promise by keeping proper depth and angle while displaying well above average hands to snag anything that comes in his range.
His ability to track passes, even those not thrown in his zone, will be a plus as the number of tipped balls hitting the ground should go down and support for anything thrown less than 20 yards to the edges should come quickly.
Size and speed has already been addressed. However, an area of concern is quickness, especially laterally. 
Quickness is different than speed, although speed does play a factor. 
Grier's mental reaction time appears to be solid. However, his muscles are following suit a little slower than one typically would like in an SEC linebacker when moving side to side.
He takes the right angle to cut off backs, but despite facing AAC speed and size, Grier has to stretch himself physically to pull down runners who are a quarter step from being able to run through his arms or completely past him. 
Considering the SEC is loaded with NFL talent with two sets of NFL talent behind it at running back while sporting an array of speedy and often powerful runners at quarterback, this is a major concern.
It's hard not to anticipate those tackles with his arms toward the sideline or angled upfield turning into deep runs into the secondary if he doesn't really apply himself in preparation for what is his last and only chance to show he can do this consistently against elite talent.

FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — There seems to be a growing number of coaches over all the chaos going on these days in college football.
Arkansas coach Sam Pittman said Wednesday that Arkansas was doing better than some, but not as well as others which is a fancy way of saying they are doing the best they can do.

The bottom line in all this is the combination of basically college free agency and the whole NIL business no one can get a handle on is proving to be as deadly as it sounded when the whole thing first came up.
No one can regulate NIL. Schools are trying to but there is at least a player or two that went with is own agent to do his own deal. Everybody is scared any move to walk it back is going to get the the lawyers involved.
Nobody really wants that.
While others seem to be offering up resistance, everybody is having to play by the same rules. That's not keeping Texas A&M's Jimbo Fisher from joining a number of folks expressing their discontent.
And, to the surprise of absolutely no one, Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin had the perfect social media response.
Pittman, at least won't weigh in mainly because I haven't seen much evidence he does that stuff himself. Not a criticism because I don't, either.
Fisher was a little more straightforward than Pittman. He's absolutely correct, though, in his assessment because even the NFL has some regulations on free agency and a salary cap they must stay under.
The penalties are directly financial, not just taken off television or missing a postseason game. That costs everybody too much money.
But it's not going anywhere anytime soon, which has everything in this complete chaos right now.
While coaches don't think the chaos is good for college football, it is creating a buzz about it. That means more eyes on games which equals more money.
Everybody likes that.

https://www.si.com/college/arkansas/hogs-mens-basketball/nick-smith-jr-status-up-in-air-for-awhile,"Worry, Guess All You Want, Muss Figuring Out How to Win Games","When Nick Smith Jr. gets on floor every time, nobody knows and won't for awhile
FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — It's going to be maddening for a few weeks.
With freshman guard Nick Smith Jr. apparently going to be a game day decision — maybe each game — Arkansas fans will have their blood pressure going up and down constantly.
The rumors help. With those, people that get it right that week can tell everyone they knew it while everybody else didn't. Hey, sooner or later, just about every one of them will probably come true.
""Nick is a competitor and he looked forward to playing for the Razorbacks,"" Hogs coach Eric Musselman said after an 85-51 win over UNC-Asheville. ""He's kind of been in and out of the lineup, or whatever, and we just want him to get healthy as quickly as possible and for him to be 100 percent.""
Arkansas Razorbacks guard Nick Smith Jr. sits on the bench during the game against the UNC Asheville Bulldogs at Bud Walton Arena. (Nelson Chenault / USA TODAY Sports)
All of that tends to point towards some type of injury that isn't going to be made worse by playing and getting some type of surgery on it won't particularly help it.
At least that's what you hope. The thought anybody would try to get it a little better so he could play one or two more games would be a bad idea for everybody involved.
While it would be nice, it may not be necessary.
""For the other guys, everybody got an opportunity tonight,"" Musselman said.
If you had Joseph Pinion and Jalen Graham punched on your bingo card for Wednesday night to lead a scoring parade, please yell a louder.
I didn't expect it, either.
""Joseph Pinion did a great job,"" Musselman said. ""He stepped up and knocked down some shots. His experience was really important playing 19 minutes tonight. That was great for Joseph.

As always, Musselman found a way to use it for evaluation when the Hogs start playing in the SEC. That grind starts next week and things will get more interesting.
Now he's got that all-important teaching film of several players who haven't seen the floor much.
""The game the way it unfolded with Nick not playing, (Trevon Brazile) not playing and Jordan Walsh and Anthony Black getting two fouls in the first half, it allowed us to ... what could happen in the next couple games for other guys to figure out that maybe we play three bigs at a time and we have to figure it out on the fly.""
In other words, if this team can have Smith hitting full stride by the second week of January, things are going to be more interesting heading into February when everything really does mean more.
We start sorting out the seeding and who should be high and low. 
Musselman has to prepare for the possibility this problem may never let Smith get this team to the full potential all year. That wasn't going to happen when Brazile went down with a season-ending knee injury a couple of weeks ago.
He's not going into a lot of details about it, either. That doesn't keep us from asking him every opportunity, a few times several different ways.

""I'm not going to, I mean, he's out indefinitely and that's what it is,"" Musselman said. ""So, there's nothing else. He's out indefinitely and he's going to continue to rehab as best as he can.""
The players don't sound like they have a clue, either.
Meanwhile, Musselman will just keep figuring what the guys that can play can do.
So far that's looking like it's not exactly doom and gloom.
The Hogs (11-1) will have a few days off for the holidays before returning to campus to begin preparations for the SEC schedule.
Arkansas will open up league play on Wednesday, December 28, at LSU (11-1). Tipoff between the Razorbacks and Tigers is set for 8 p.m. and will be broadcast on ESPN2 or ESPNU and fuboTV.

https://www.si.com/college/arkansas/hogs-mens-basketball/razorbacks-joseph-pinion-jalen-graham-unc-ashville-bulldogs-sec-musselman,Razorbacks Make Run at Reaching Walsh's Goal,"Pinion, Graham steal the show, make case for more time against UNC-Ashville
FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. – Following the win over Bradley in North Little Rock, guard Jordan Walsh expressed a personal goal of beating a team by 40 early enough to guarantee Cade Arbogast and Blake Lawson at least eight minutes of well-earned time in the spotlight.
Well, Wednesday night against UNC-Ashville, it appeared the rest of the team took on that goal also as Arkansas knocked off the Bulldogs 85-51 despite not scoring a single field goal in the final 2:42 of the game.
UNC-Ashville was overwhelmed from the outset as the length and athleticism of the Razorbacks was too much. 
The Arkansas defense was so exhausting that Bulldogs' forward Nick McMullen fell to the ground around the 10:20 mark and had so little energy to get up as he watched the ball go the other way that he barely crossed mid-court by the time Anthony Black, who was guarding McMullen, got the rebound, pushed the ball up the floor, and worked the ball over to Ricky Council who found a cutting Jalen Graham for the dunk that gave the Hogs a 22-9 lead.
The lead stretched to 30-9 less than a minute later before UNC-Ashville finally reached double digits on a free throw.
Arbogast and Lawson did get extended minutes, clocking in just shy of three minutes of work. It was still a bit short of Walsh's goal, but a strong step in the right direction nonetheless.
Dunks were definitely the story of the night, along with Graham, who led the team with 16 points in only 19 minutes of play. 10 of those points came before the midway mark of the first half.
Dunks and lay-ups were the story for both good and bad reasons. 
Musselman will likely have a section of practice dedicated to lay-ups and dunks at some point before SEC play opens next week. That's because the Razorbacks missed so many, even when uncontested. 
However, the one person who didn't miss his dunks was Joseph Pinion. The sharpshooter hit the floor and knocked down a couple of quick threes, but then got the house warmed up by letting many of the fans see him dunk for the first time.
Then he put all doubts that he too has ridiculous athleticism with a highlight dunk where the Morrilton product lept just shy of the SEC logo, curling the ball in against his arm before dropping the hammer and bringing down the house.
It left a usually animated bench known for its antics when the rim starts rocking completely stunned while former Arkansas Razorback Joe Kleine instantly declared Pinion an entrant into the college dunk contest at the end of the season.
It was a memorable moment that not only put the freshman in double figures for the first time in his Razorback career, it caused Graham to playfully quip after the game that Pinion proved some white men can jump.
Graham also proved his ability to elevate earlier in the game when Pinion floated a high arching lob that Graham had to get into the stratosphere to pull down for the jam to put every on notice that this was their night.
Musselman's Razorbacks will take a week off to enjoy the holiday festivities before traveling to Baton Rouge to follow up the Liberty Bowl with the SEC opener on the road against LSU at 8 p.m.

https://www.si.com/college/arkansas/hogs-mens-basketball/razorbacks-eric-musselman-nick-smith-simmons-bank-ashville-unc-sec-trevon-brazile,No Need to Waste Time Worrying About Nick Smith's Legs,"So many people called radio shows concerned about something that isn't a concern at all for the Razorbacks
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – A loud groan reached from around the corner into the hallway that leads to the media room in Simmons Bank Arena. 
Normally, there would be no one to hear it with the first half already started, but a pair of stragglers rounded the corner just in time to see the cause of noise.
There on the floor was All-American and projected NBA first rounder in the last place Arkansas coach Eric Musselman wanted and definitely the last place Smith hoped he would be barely midway through his North Little Rock homecoming – on the ground writhing in pain under the arena bleachers.
Someone with the team said something that was drowned out by the yelps of pain and another gentleman who appeared to be with the training staff asked what was wrong. 
Through a forced grimace, Smith forced out ""It won't stop cramping.""
He then motioned toward his thigh area.
It was clearly painful as muscle cramps of all types tend to be. Equally clear was that even if the trainers got the cramping to stop, Smith wasn't about to go back into a game that hadn't been in doubt since the opening few minutes.
Local boy or not, Smith was too valuable to the overall goal, especially after forward Trevon Brazile's season ending injury, to take the risk. They had been cautious with his legs to this point, so no need for unnecessary exposure for a half that couldn't make the season more successful despite friends and family in the stands.
Fans were going to fret. They do every time one of Musselman's thoroughbreds rolls an ankle or gets an eyelash in his eye. 
That's how fans are.
Musselman would just explain in the postgame press conference and everyone could relax.
""He got taped at halftime and the tape felt a little uncomfortable,"" Musselman said after the game. ""You know, I just didn't feel the need to put him back in when he got taped up at halftime and then left again to get retaped.""
And that moment of caution wasn't something that was lightly considered. While fans in the stands wildly imagined all sorts of horrors to the ligaments and bones of Smith, Musselman and his staff talked out whether to put him back in.
""I discussed it on the bench quite a bit with Coach [Keith] Smart because of his experience and Coach [Gus] Argenal,"" Musselman said. ""The three of us talked about it. With the flow and the way the game was going, it just felt like there wasn't a need to probably put him back in at that juncture.""
Despite those very public comments, fans filled the call lines of local radio shows asking about Smith's health, still believing he was legitimately injured. 
Musselman even addressed that it wouldn't be anything that would prevent him from playing against UNC-Ashville. However, unless you were in the room or had the press conference cranked up dangerously loud, the question to Musselman's yes-no answer was imperceptible, therefore removing context to his answer.
So, if you're one of those Razorback fans who worried at times that Smith is about to miss several more games or that another Brazile-like announcement is about to drop, it's all cool. 
Even if Smith, for some strange reason doesn't play tonight, it won't have anything to do directly with what happened under the bleachers at Simmons Bank Arena Saturday night. 
What went on there was nothing a few bananas, some salt tablets and a bottle of water couldn't solve back in the day, and everyone knows sports medicine has come a long way since then. 
So spend the hours leading up to the game chopping some firewood to take care of something in need of actual worry with this cold front coming in, because when it comes to Nick Smith and Saturday night, all is well, and to all a good night.

https://www.si.com/college/arkansas/hogs-football/sam-pittman-attacking-portal-now,Sam Pittman: Hogs Not Finished Bringing in New Players,"Razorbacks ready now to ""attack"" transfer portal and add more depth
FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — Arkansas coach Sam Pittman made it clear Wednesday afternoon he's not finished chasing players.
""We'll add a couple more in high school and the rest in the portal,"" he said.
Right now, the class is ranked No. 22 in the 247Sports composite recruiting classes. Pittman noted that, so he knows fans and everybody else watches that to make judgements, which is pretty much accurate.

How long they stay there will depend on the players they sign and who everybody else lands.
Maybe the biggest news out of his press conference is he's expecting six to 12 more players on campus between a new period of visits Jan. 4-8, which gives everybody a better chance before February.
Getting 16 of the 23 players he's already gotten on campus when the spring semester starts helps everybody in a spring practice.
""It will change the depth on our team,"" Pittman said.
That's what the Razorbacks have desperately needed.
""With injuries and everything else you have to have that depth these days,"" Pittman said and he made it clear several times the focus now is transfers.
""We're ready to attack the portal,"" he said.

The biggest transfer right now is quarterback Jacolby Criswell that Pittman tried to land when the Morrilton star was making his college coach.
There wasn't enough time to really give him a solid chance of landing him with the Hogs in 2019, but he did make an impression that was strong enough to get him really quickly this time.
""We knew there would be an upgrade there,"" he said.
Criswell and high school signee Malachi Singleton out of Georgia will both be on campus in January for spring practice this year.
That is huge.

https://www.si.com/college/arkansas/hogs-womens-basketball/oregon-puts-end-to-razorbacks-hot-start,Hogs Come Close Against Oregon in San Diego Invitational,"Samara Spencer's double-double not enough to keep Razorbacks' hot start going.
SAN DIEGO — No. 17-19 Arkansas has finally lost a game.
No. 16-15 Oregon put the Razorbacks’ undefeated start to a halt Tuesday afternoon at the San Diego Invitational.
In a highly competitive game, the Hogs led by seven points with 8:30 left in the game, but Oregon made big shots down the stretch and the Hogs didn't make a field goal for over six minutes, leading to an 85-78 loss.
Samara Spencer continued her great play with her first career double-double off 20 points and a career-high 10 assists, while Erynn Barnum also logged a 20-piece with 22 points and nine boards.
Makayla Daniels helped the Razorbacks get on the board first with a jumper, but after a scoring drought for over two minutes, Oregon took the 10-4 lead with dominance in the paint halfway through the first quarter.
Barnum scored two straight baskets to pull the Razorbacks within a bucket at the media timeout, 10-8, and then Spencer tied the game with a layup. Barnum was on fire, registering back-to-back 3-pointers, while Rylee Langerman knocked down one of her own.
Oregon would tie the game at 22 following a 5-0 run, but a Barnum layup and Langerman free throw put the Razorbacks up at the first break, 25-22. Barnum logged 14 of her 22 points in the first frame.
Arkansas didn’t score for the first four minutes and some change of the second quarter until Barnum logged her third 3-pointer of the game and Daniels added a layup. At the media timeout, the Razorbacks were ahead, 30-24.
Oregon came out of the media timeout with a 5-1 run, but back-to-back Maryam Dauda baskets put the Razorbacks out of a hole, forcing Oregon to take a timeout with Arkansas ahead, 35-29. Oregon’s timeout was beneficial, as a 6-0 run tied the score at 35 with a minute and some change to play in the half.
After a handful of fouls called on the Razorbacks in the final few minutes of the half, Oregon was able to shoot some freebies to take the lead. A Spencer jumper closed the Razorbacks in within a point, as the Ducks led 38-37 at the half.
Daniels helped the Razorbacks go back ahead with a layup out of the half, but after a scoring drought for over two minutes, Oregon had the five-point edge. A 3-pointer by Daniels inched the Razorbacks ahead by two, 44-42, four minutes into the second half.
Just before the media timeout, Daniels tied the game at 48 with the Razorbacks’ eighth of 12 triples of the ballgame.
The game tied twice more until Arkansas closed out the quarter on a 7-2 run courtesy of Saylor Poffenbarger’s layup and 3-pointer, as well as Dauda’s second chance layup as the buzzer sounded. Arkansas led 59-55 going into the fourth quarter.
Langerman drilled down a 3-pointer for Arkansas’ first score of the fourth quarter.
Oregon cut the lead to three on the next possession with a basket, but Arkansas sparked a 4-0 run thanks to a Barnum free throw and Daniels triple off a Ducks’ turnover.
Oregon called a timeout and Arkansas had the 66-59 edge with 8:22 remaining in the game. The Ducks outscored the Razorbacks 30-19 in the fourth, while holding the Razorbacks to zero field goals for a six-minute stretch.
Arkansas suffered its first loss of the season, 85-78.
Game Highlights
• Barnum led the Razorbacks with 22 points, her third 20-piece of the season and in her career. She nailed down a career-high three 3-pointers, while adding nine rebounds
• Spencer logged a near triple-double off 20 points, a career-high 10 assists and seven rebounds, while playing 39 minutes. She became the first Razorback since Destiny Slocum in 2021 to log a double-double in points and assists
• Daniels continues to make a big impact in her return to the floor with 15 points, nine of those points coming off 3-pointers and three boards
• Poffenbarger registered her fifth 10+ rebound game of the year with 11 boards along with five points
• Langerman recorded seven points and seven rebounds across 25 minutes played off the bench
• Dauda was also big off the bench with six points
• Chrissy Carr and Emrie Ellis were the lone Razorbacks with a positive +/-, while Poffenbarger and Dauda were even
Next Game
Arkansas will play No. 3 Ohio State or South Florida on Wednesday at 3 p.m. CST to wrap up the San Diego Invitational and non-conference play.

https://www.si.com/college/arkansas/hogs-mens-basketball/musselman-alabama-tennessee-kentucky-auburn-ncaa-tournament-seed-sec-gonzaga-ucla-razorbacks,Razorbacks Will Have to Go It Alone in Quest for No. 1 Seed,"Help from rest of SEC, other teams on schedule probably not happening this year
FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. – Over the past three seasons, for the Razorbacks to get onto a path to make it into the NCAA tournament, or in the case of the last two, carve a way to the Elite 8, help was needed from other teams. 
A key win by a fellow SEC team or a key loss by someone outside the conference added value to Arkansas wins while clearing the debris needed to climb the NCAA ladder.
That's not happening this year. If you need that demonstrated by reality, take the AP rankings. Everybody and their brother has lost in front of Arkansas this year, yet, despite continuing to win, the Razorbacks aren't moving. 
Bradley is no killer by any stretch of the imagination, but the Braves are a projected No. 13 seed, so it should have had some positive effect. 
Yet, there's Arkansas stuck in the mud at No. 10, where it fell last week following wins over UNC-Greensboro and Oklahoma. 
Of course, the SEC schedule starts next week, but the help from the conference schedule is going to be minimal. 
There have been a few SEC wins against ranked teams from other conferences, pretty much all of which came via Alabama and Tennessee, but with people just now starting to pay attention to basketball, most will only remember the high profile blood bath the league took this past week.
Tennessee lost to No. 9 Arizona. 
Alabama lost to No. 15 Gonzaga.
Kentucky lost to No. 16 UCLA.
Auburn lost to an unranked USC team.
All ranked bell cow programs. All making it clear to future committee members presumably how much better basketball is out West than in the Southeast part of the country.
As a result, the big talk in college basketball was how the SEC was the weekend's biggest loser instead of the Big Bad Wolves the conference wants it to be. 
Alabama's road win over Houston, Tennessee's wins over Gonzaga and Kansas, along with ... well, apparently Auburn and Kentucky have fallen face first every time a ranked opponent has shown up on the schedule, but those wins by Alabama and Tennessee have been wiped out by the full conference collapse against ranked opponents this past week.
To make matters worse, then No. 8 Creighton forgot how to play basketball after an epic 90-87 win over Arkansas in Maui. The Blue Jays haven't won a single game since. 
As for then No. 17 San Diego St., which was to be the big win for Arkansas coming out of the Maui Classic in a dramatic overtime finish – with emphasis on the dramatic – the world dropped out from under the Aztecs, as did their ranking.
If Arkansas wants to dig itself out of the mud at No. 10, the Hogs are not only going to have to win, they're going to have to win big. The path to a No. 1 or high No. 2 seed will have to be littered with the bludgeoned carcasses of literally everyone left on the schedule. 
The only other way things might tip in the Hogs' favor is if the SEC goes in and dominates in the Big 12-SEC challenge, thus replacing the image that a conference loss for the Razorbacks is the equivalent to two in the Pac 12. 
Other schools will get the nod if aren't dominant in winning because everyone will have that distant memory of the SEC going up against other conferences in mid-December and getting blanked if the Big 12 plays .500 basketball or better in that challenge.
As Arkansas fans know, Musselman's goal is always to just get to the tournament and sort it out game by game. It's led to the Elite 8 each of the past two seasons.
 However, the prestige of a No. 1 seed and dreams of a theoretically easier path back to the Elite 8 have Arkansas fans hoping for help. 
Help that likely isn't coming.

FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — Arkansas will face something they haven't seen much in a hot start to the regular season.
UNC-Asheville rolls into Bud Walton Arena on Wednesday night with a 6-10 guy that has played in the SEC before. He's also having a big start to their season.
Drew Pember dropped 40 in their season opener against UCF and has four double-doubles, scoring more than six times.
For good measure, he's also having an impact on their defense.
""Pember, especially offensively, is just having an absolutely phenomenal year,"" Razorbacks coach  Eric Musselman said Monday. ""He’s averaging a double-double. He presents a lot of problems. Obviously the 17 made threes at 41.%. He’s an excellent free throw shooter at 85 plus. Then 89 free throws attempted. 
""He’s blocked a lot of shots ... 30 blocks is a lot. A high steal rate. He can really run the floor. He’s done a good job as an assist player as well from the center spot. It’s not often you see somebody second on a team or third on a team in assists with 23. He’s a player that is definitely a guy that can score the ball in multiple ways.""
Pember transferred from Tennessee and he's seen the sights in Fayetteville before. He knows what to expect.
In their last game against East Tennessee State, he nailed a game-winning three-pointer.
""He’s a player you can’t give air space to and you’ve got to crowd him,"" Musselman said. ""He’s got a pretty good first step off the bounce. That’s why he’s a tough cover, but that was a shot that — under presser, under duress, game-winning shot — that’s why he’s one of the top guys in his league if not the top player in their league.""
The biggest thing, though, maybe somehow figuring out a way to make sure they don't start lighting up the scoreboard with three-pointers. That can cause a lot of problems for the Hogs.
""They’re a great three-point shooting team, they really are,"" Musselman said. ""They shoot deep shots, they shoot quick shots in transition. They shoot shots with confidence.""
It's going to put pressure on the Hogs' defense they haven't seen this season.
""They like to get out and run,"" Musselman said. ""We’ve got to have great transition defense and obviously we like to run as well. Transition defense will be a big part of this game as I think they average 83 a game.""
Tip-off for the game will be at 8 p.m. and televised on the SEC Network and fuboTV.
