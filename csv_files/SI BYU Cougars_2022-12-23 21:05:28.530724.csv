The officially licensed collected - The Royal Blue (TRB) - launched on Thursday, BYU athletics announced. The TRB is independent of BYU athletics and ""plans to pool funds from fans, alumni and businesses to help facilitate NIL deals and monetize student-athlete brands.""
According to its website, the TRB vision is to ""make BYU a consistent national leader in collegiate athletic performance and see all its student-athletes promote light and goodness in life beyond sports.""
The Royal Blue ""was created with a goal of supporting student-athletes at BYU by facilitating legal and compliant NIL opportunities as well as helping those athletes prepare for the future."" 
The last element, preparing for the future, is what will set BYU's collective apart from other collectives across the country. TRB will focus on helping BYU student athletes ""thrive in life, family, faith, and professional pursuits.""
The Royal Blue will be run by a Board of Directors comprised of accomplished business professionals. Ampelis CEO Lon Henderson and business owner Mark Comer will serve as co-chairs of The Royal Blue collective. Former BYU basketball player Craig Cusick will also serve on the Board of Directors alongside Brian Hawkins, Andrew Van Buren, Wilford Clyde, Josh James, and Sterling Sessions.
According to its website, ""The Royal Blue intends to operate as a public charity as described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code."" Meaning contributions to TRB will be tax deductible.
TRB will completely change the way that BYU has operated in the new space of name, image, and likeness. This is a very positive development that will help BYU athletics attract and retain top talent.

https://www.si.com/college/byu/football/byu-quarterback-jaren-hall-accepts-senior-bowl-invite,BYU Quarterback Jaren Hall Accepts Senior Bowl Invite,"On Thursday morning, the Reese's Senior Bowl announced that BYU quarterback Jaren Hall has accepted an invitation to participate in this year's Senior Bowl. Hall has not officially announced his plans for next season, but his accepting the invitation indicates that he will likely forego his final season of eligibility and enter the NFL Draft. Hall spent five years with the BYU football program (2018-2022) and the last two seasons as BYU's starting quarterback. In his two years as a starter, Hall was one of the most efficient quarterbacks in the country and one of the best at protecting the football. 
At BYU, Hall threw for 6,174 passing yards and 52 touchdowns to just 11 interceptions. He also added 800 yards and 9 touchdowns on the ground. Hall totaled nine games in his career of 300 passing yards or more.
Hall will also be remembered for leading BYU to wins over arch-rival Utah and ranked foes like Arizona State and Baylor. He will also be remembered for his leadership and moments like this one with kicker Jake Oldroyd.
Hall's injury history and age will likely work against him in the upcoming draft, but his arm talent, leadership, film, and communication ability give him a great chance to be an NFL Draft pick. Hall is also a great athlete and his ability to gain yards on the ground changes an offense. He will have the opportunity to show his intangible skills at the Senior Bowl.
Hall is the third member of BYU's offense to accept an invitation to the Senior Bowl. He joins offensive tackle Blake Freeland and wide receiver Puka Nacua.

https://www.si.com/college/byu/recruiting/byu-signs-boise-state-transfer-isaiah-bagnah,BYU Signs Boise State Transfer Isaiah Bagnah,"Bagnah tallied six sacks in his last full season at Boise State
Historically speaking, signing has been centered around high school and JUCO recruits. With the addition of the transfer portal, however, transfers also factor into signing day. On Wednesday, BYU signed Boise State transfer Isaiah Bagnah. Bagnah, an edge/outside linebacker who has two seasons of eligibility remaining, received offers from NAU, Jacksonville State, Montana, Eastern Washington, Hawaii, and BYU after entering the transfer portal.
Bagnah played at Boise State for four seasons and appeared in 20 games before entering the transfer portal. Bagnah tallied six sacks in 2021 which was the second most on his team. Scott Mattlock led Boise State's sack leader that season was Scott Mattlock with seven.
In 2022, Bagnah was coached by now BYU assistant coach Kelly Poppinga. Following the 2022 season, Poppinga left Boise State to take a job at BYU.
Bagnah fills an immediate need that the BYU defense has needed to fill for years: pass rushing. Statistically speaking, Bagnah becomes the most proven pass rusher on the roster. No BYU defender has tallied five or more sacks in a single season since Corbin Kaufusi in 2018. Bagnah's ability to pressure the quarterback makes him a candidate to play right away in Provo.
  In 20 career games played, Bagnah has racked up 20 sacks, 59 tackles, and a forced fumble that came against BYU in 2021. Bagnah is an important addition for a BYU defense that is looking to add more talent before next season.

As of this writing, a few BYU targets have not officially made their college decisions. A few names to watch are Timpview DL Moteaki Mounga and Snow College OL Isaiah Jatta. BYU has also been recruiting four-star tight end Walker Lyons, but Lyons is expected to wait and sign during the traditional signing period. Both Jatta and Mounga officially visited BYU over the last month.
Mounga holds competing offers from Utah State, UNLV, New Mexico State, and SUU. Jatta has received over a dozen offers from the likes of Auburn, Colorado, Cal, Syracuse, and more. Jatta recently took official visits to Colorado and Auburn.
Speaking of Snow College, BYU offered three Snow College defensive lineman on Monday: David Latu, Stone Mulitalo, and John Taumoepeau. Those are names to monitor on Wednesday.
Lastly, BYU has pursued Timpview running back Micah Beckstead as a PWO. Beckstead holds a few scholarship offers from smaller schools like Weber State. If Beckstead does not sign a national letter of intent with one of those schools, it could be a sign that he is headed to Provo. Preferred walk-ons do not sign national letters of intent.
BYU has been pursuing four-star running back LJ Martin, a Stanford commit, ever since former Stanford head coach Dave Shaw stepped down. Martin was on BYU's campus for an official visit a few weeks ago. It's rare for BYU to flip a commitment on signing day, but the Cougars made a push and got him on a visit. He is a name to at least monitor as the day goes on.
Players in the transfer portal don't have to decide where they will transfer by signing day, so high school and JUCO recruits will be the primary focus on Wednesday. In the past, however, BYU has announced some transfers that commit prior to signing day. Last year, for example, BYU announced Oregon transfer Kingsley Suamataia on signing day.
BYU recently received a commitment from UNLV transfer running back Aidan Robbins. He is a name to watch for tomorrow if BYU announces him. The Cougars have also been pursuing other transfers like running back Daniyel Ngata, defensive back Armani Chatman, quarterback Kedon Slovis, and edge Isaiah Bagnah among others. Signing day could be an opportunity for a few transfers to commit to their next schools.
Stay tuned for live signing day updates on Wednesday.

https://www.si.com/college/byu/football/tracking-the-transfers-in-and-out-of-the-byu-football-program,Tracking the Transfers In and Out of the BYU Football Program,"BYU has seen 11 players enter the transfer portal, and they are starting to add players from the portal as well
It's transfer season and BYU has seen 11 players transfer out of the program and 2 players transfer into the program. This article will serve as tracker for the transfers both in and out of the BYU football program.
Longtime starter and 2022 team captain Keenan Pili announced on Friday that he plans to enter the transfer portal. Pili racked up 191 tackles over four seasons at BYU.
Former four-star recruit Logan Fano entered the transfer portal and committed to the University of Utah a few days later. Fano's departure is perhaps the most impactful of any player on this list, Fano had the potential to be a cornerstone of BYU's defense in the future.
BYU linebacker Tate Romney entered the transfer portal after just one season with the program. Romney, a former three-star recruit, turned down various P5 schools when he signed with BYU.
Tight end Dallin Holker quit three games into the season to enter the transfer portal. In three seasons at BYU, Holker tallied 42 receptions for 521 receiving yards and 3 touchdowns.
Backup quarterback Jacob Conover announced his plans to enter the Transfer Portal on Friday. After returning home from his mission, Conover joined the BYU football program in time for the 2020 season where he ran the scout team. In 2021, Conover competed for the starting job against Jaren Hall and Baylor Romney. Conover ended the competition as BYU’s third-string quarterback that season and appeared in just one game against Utah State. Against the Aggies, Conover was 5/9 and he threw for 45 yards.
Conover was BYU’s second-string quarterback behind Jaren Hall for the entirety of the 2022 season. Conover appeared in just one game - the regular season finale at Stanford. Conover attempted just one pass in that game as BYU dominated the game on the ground.
Conover committed to in-state Arizona State a few days after entering the transfer portal.
Offensive lineman Campbell Barrington announced that he will enter the transfer portal. Barrington has been in BYU's two-deep along the offensive line over the last two seasons. In 2021, Barrington took over for Harris LaChance in the starting lineup when LaChance went out with injury.
This season, Barrington was listed as a co-starter at right tackle alongside Kingsley Suamataia. Suamataia ended up winning the starting job and played the lion's share of the reps.
Wide receiver Terrence Fall entered the transfer portal after three seasons in the program. Fall, a native of France, only played 28 snaps in his career. Fall has received offers from NAU and Northern Colorado (where Ed Lamb is now head coach) since entering the portal.
A class of 2022 signee that spent only one year in the program, Talin Togiai is an offensive lineman from Rigby, Idaho. He signed with BYU over offers from Nebraska and Utah.
Another 2022 signee, Nathaniel Gillis came to BYU as a developmental defensive back prospect. Gillis opted to transfer after not seeing the field this season.
Perhaps the most surprising player to enter the transfer portal, Clark Barrington was a three-year starter for BYU along the offensive line who started 40 games. It was assumed that Barrington would test NFL waters after this season, instead he will head to another program. Barrington will be one of the most coveted players in the transfer portal.
Like Nathaniel Gillis, Korbyn Green was a development defensive back prospect that signed with the class of 2022. Green announced his plans to enter the transfer portal this morning after seeing limited playing time this season.
  BYU has secured its first major transfer of this recruiting cycle on Monday morning. The Cougars received a commitment from running back transfer Aidan Robbins. Robbins, who ran for over 1,000 yards last season, will transfer to BYU from UNLV. After entering the transfer portal, Robbins took visits to BYU and UCLA before committing to BYU and running backs coach Harvey Unga.
BYU added a specialist through the transfer portal. Kicker Will Ferrin will transfer from Boise State to BYU.

https://www.si.com/college/byu/football/byu-lands-running-back-aidan-robbins-from-transfer-portal,BYU Lands Running Back Aidan Robbins from Transfer Portal,"Robbins ran for over 1,000 yards last season
BYU has secured its first major transfer of this recruiting cycle. On Monday morning, the Cougars received a commitment from running back transfer Aidan Robbins. Robbins, who ran for over 1,000 yards last season, will transfer to BYU from UNLV. After entering the transfer portal, Robbins took visits to BYU and UCLA before committing to BYU and running backs coach Harvey Unga.
Thanks to the extra COVID year of eligibility, Robbins has two seasons of eligibility remaining. He is also immediately eligible to play as a graduate transfer.
Aidan Robbins was a highly-touted recruit from Louisville, Kentucky in the class of 2019. He signed with nearby Louisville where he spent the first three years of his career. After three years with limited opportunities at Louisville, Robbins transferred to UNLV last season where he was the feature running back. Robbins took advantage of his increased role, running for 1,011 yards and 9 touchdowns. He also added 23 receptions for 125 yards and a touchdown.
Robbins' size and skillset is unique. Listed at 6'3, 230 pounds, Robbins is a big back that has the strength to be a bruising running back. He also has the speed and agility to put his foot into the ground and break off long runs. Robbins has the talent to contribute right away for BYU.
As a high school recruit, Robbins committed to Louisville early in the recruiting cycle. He also received offers from the likes of Missouri, Ole Miss, and South Carolina. When Louisville went through a head coaching change just before 2019 signing day, BYU and then running backs coach AJ Steward tried to flip Robbins to BYU. The Cougars got close - Robbins came out to BYU with his family for an official visit. In the end, Robbins opted to stay home and play at Louisville.
Years later, Robbins and BYU came full circle when Robbins committed to BYU. Although BYU's recruiting efforts in 2018 and 2019 didn't bear immediate fruit with Robbins, they did pay off eventually.
Stay tuned for more transfer portal and recruiting updates this week.

https://www.si.com/college/byu/football/the-10-highest-graded-byu-football-players-of-the-2022-season,The 10 Highest-Graded BYU Football Players of the 2022 Season,"BYU wrapped up its 2022 season on Saturday night with a win over SMU in the New Mexico Bowl. The win over SMU marked the end of the independence era as BYU will move on to bigger and better things in the Big 12 next season. 
Today, let's look at some of the best individual performers of the 2022 season. The experts over at Pro Football Focus reviewed every snap of BYU's season and handed out grades. Here are the 10 highest-graded BYU football players of the 2022 season (minimum 100 snaps).
Blake Freeland finished the season as one of the best tackles in college football. Freeland, who has accepted an invitation to the Senior Bowl, will likely be drafted in the first two days of the NFL Draft next Spring.
Freeland received a pass-blocking grade of 91.8 which ranked second in the country behind only Peter Skoronski. His overall grade of 91.0 ranked second in the country - only Notre Dame's Joe Alto received a better grade (91.7). 
Blake Freeland will go down as one of the best tackles in BYU history. In the last three seasons, Freeland played 1,129 pass-blocking snaps and allowed only one sack.
Puka Nacua was electric nealry every time he touched the football in 2022. Nacua's first touch on the year came on a 75-yard touchdown run on the first play from scrimmage. Like Freeland, Nacua has accepted an invitation to the Senior Bowl.

Nacua finished with a receiving grade of 90.1 which ranked fourth in the country. He was the highest-graded wide receiver on the West coast.

Jaren Hall was consistently productive throughout the 2022 season. Hall finished with 3,171 passing yards for 31 touchdowns and 6 interceptions. 
It has been assumed that Hall would leave BYU for the NFL after this season. He has not announced his plans to enter the draft. 
Kody Epps' season was cut short after he suffered an injury against Liberty. Prior to his injury, Epps was leading the Cougars in both receptions and receiving yards. Epps was downright dynamic this season when he was on the field - we will look back on his 2022 campaign as his breakout season.
Heading into 2023, Epps will be one of the cornerstones of the BYU offense.
Tyler Batty was the highest-graded player on the BYU defense. Batty finished with only two sacks but he was credited with 22 quarterback hurries, a team high.
Gabe Jeudy-Lally played a total of 658 snaps, the second most on the BYU defense behind only Ben Bywater (660). Juedy-Lally was one of the more consistent players across the four defensive categories: run defense, tackling, quarterback pressure, and coverage. He graded at least 75 or better in each category, the only defender to accomplish that feat.
Christopher Brooks finished the season as BYU's leading rusher. Brooks tallied 817 yards on 130 attempts, an average of 6.3 yards per carry. He also finished with six rushing touchdowns.
Micah Harper was one of the best players on the BYU defense in 2022 and his PFF grade confirms that. Harper was the second-best defender against the run according to Pro Football Focus. Harper finished with 62 total tackles, tied for second on the team.
Left guard Clark Barrington was the second best offensive lineman on the team according to Pro Football Focus. Barrington appeared in all 13 games and games and played 856 snaps.
Walk-on Blake Mangelson was credited with 12 quarterback hurries and 2 batted passes in 2022. Mangelson showed that he has the potential to play a role in BYU's defense in the future.

BYU head coach Kalani Sitake announced that quarterback Sol-Jay Maiava-Peters will start for BYU at quarterback in the New Mexico Bowl. Maiava-Peters, who has been in the program for three years, has not attempted a pass in a BYU uniform. Sol-Jay was the fourth-string quarterback heading into the season behind Jaren Hall, Jacob Conover, and Cade Fennegan. With starter Jaren Hall out with an injury and backup Jacob Conover in the transfer portal, BYU turned to Cade Fennegan and Sol-Jay Maiava-Peters in the practices leading up to the bowl game. Fennegan was been dealing with his own ankle injury and, according to Sitake, that ""factored into the competition."" This will be Sol-Jay's first career start.

The bowl game against SMU will be the first time Sol-Jay has appeared in a game since 2020 when he played in mop-up duty against Troy, Navy, and North Alabama. In those three games, Maiava-Peters didn't attempt a pass or run the football.
Sol-Jay Maiava-Peters was a Quarterback out of Washington D.C. that signed with BYU as part of the 2020 BYU Recruiting class. Before signing with BYU, Maiava-Peters had offers from programs around the country including Michigan, Utah Oregon, and Virginia among others. He committed to BYU and Coach Aaron Roderick in June of 2019.

  BYU unveiled a new ""Sailor Coug"" helmet it will wear for the New Mexico Bowl against SMU. Like the uniforms worn against Notre Dame, BYU will wear the all black uniforms with a royal and black helmet. The decal on the black helmets, however, will be the ""Sailor Coug"" logo in stead of the traditional ""Y"" logo. This is the first time that BYU has worn this uniform combination.

In addition, BYU will honor Mississippi State head coach Mike Leach with a pirate sticker. Leach, who recently passed away, was a BYU graduate and played for the BYU rugby team.
