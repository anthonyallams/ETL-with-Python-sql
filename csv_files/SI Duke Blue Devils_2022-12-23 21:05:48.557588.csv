But it wasn't until this summer, after receiving a notably early Duke basketball offer in May, that the 6-foot-8, 195-pound small forward made a giant splash nationally and earned a five-star rating.
And as of this week's announcement, Flagg, who turned 16 years old a few days ago and now sits No. 2 on the 247Sports 2025 Rankings while attending prep powerhouse Montverde Academy (Fla.), is the youngest USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year since the award's inception in 1980.

As a mere 15-year-old on the USA Men's U17 National Team this summer at the FIBA Men's U17 World Cup in Spain, Cooper Flagg helped lead his squad to a 7-0 mark on their way to a gold medal.
His versatility and intensity on both ends of the floor, evident in his stat lines from that trip, are clearly off the charts.
  Flagg made headlines frequently while averaging 9.3 points, 10.0 rebounds, 2.4 steals, and 2.9 blocks per game, despite being more than a year younger than most of the players he faced. Furthermore, he saved his best performance for the gold-sealing 79-67 win over Spain in July, tallying 10 points, 17 boards, eight steals, and four blocks.
Sure, Flagg hasn't named finalists in his recruitment and might be a year or more from choosing a college. That said, his admitted Duke basketball fandom as a kid and early offer from first-year head coach Jon Scheyer suggest the Blue Devils are likely to be contenders in the race until the finish line.
Duke's only other 2025 targets are the Boozer twins, Cameron and Cayden, the sons of 2001 Blue Devil national champion and two-time NBA All-Star Carlos Boozer.

https://www.si.com/college/duke/basketball/duke-basketball-star-surprising-claim-recruitment,Recent Duke star's surprising claim about recruitment,"During the fall and winter of his junior year in high school (2019-20), Paolo Banchero took official visits to the Duke basketball program, UNC, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Gonzaga.
His October 2019 weekend trip to Durham included attending the Blue Devils' annual Countdown to Craziness in Cameron Indoor Stadium. Countless recruits whose official visits coincide with the CTC experience have committed to Duke, often soon after returning home or sometimes before they even leave campus.
Of course, Banchero, who won ACC Rookie of the Year as a Blue Devil and went No. 1 overall at the 2022 NBA Draft, did choose Duke in the end. He became the star of Hall of Famer Mike Krzyzewski's last team before the program's reins went to then-associate head coach Jon Scheyer.
RELATED: Ranking all 26 Duke one-and-dones in history
But Banchero didn't pledge allegiance to the Blue Devils until the beginning of his senior year at O'Dea High School in Seattle, 10 months after that official visit.
Now, that delay makes perfect sense given what the Orlando Magic power forward — the leading candidate for NBA Rookie of the Year — said this week on Blue Devil legend JJ Redick's The Old Man & The Three podcast:
""If I'm being honest, Duke was actually my worst visit,"" Banchero admitted.
Redick then put the 20-year-old on the spot by asking which Duke basketball player served as his host that weekend.
""I don't want to throw him under the bus,"" Banchero answered. ""I don't want to throw him under the bus, but it's [now] my dawg. It was my worst visit, if I'm being 100 percent honest. You can ask Coach Scheyer.""
Last season's Duke basketball co-captain, Wendell Moore Jr., now a rookie with the Minnesota Timberwolves, later tweeted he, as a Blue Devil freshman, was Banchero's host and that ""[Scheyer] let me hear it after this one...""
So what didn't Paolo Banchero like about his Duke visit? What did Wendell Moore Jr. do wrong? And what made Banchero decide to go with the Blue Devils anyway?
Well, he didn't address the first question or the second. However, he noted that the basketball-related portion of his trip gave him positive vibes that ""trumped the whole experience.""
And it sounds like his trust in Krzyzewski sealed the deal months later.
""[Coach K] said something to me during my recruiting process, that it was kind of a moment where I was like, Alright, this where I'm going,"" Banchero explained. ""He was just basically like, 'Look, you're going to be a top pick wherever you go...But if you want to be the No. 1 pick, and you want to be the best player you can be, there's no other coach you should try to play for.'""
It'd be hard to argue that Coach K didn't make good on that promise.

https://www.si.com/college/duke/nba-blue-devils/duke-basketball-paolo-banchero-rarefied-rookie,Paolo Banchero reaches rarefied rookie air,"Until Wednesday night, per ESPN Stats & Info, only two NBA players in the past 40 years had scored 20 or more points in at least 20 of their first 26 games. One was UNC basketball alum Michael Jordan with the Chicago Bulls in 1984. And the other was Duke basketball product Zion Williamson with the New Orleans Pelicans in 2020.
  Now, that exclusive group includes a second NBA Blue Devil in Paolo Banchero, who, like Williamson, went No. 1 overall in the NBA Draft following an ACC Rookie of the Year campaign at Duke. 
RELATED: Stacking up all 26 Duke one-and-dones in history
In his 26th game as a pro, the Orlando Magic's 6-foot-10, 250-pound rookie forward tallied 23 points, including the following bullish bucket with under a minute to play against the Houston Rockets to help seal a 116-110 road win.
In fairness to Jordan, he needed only 24 games to post his 20th 20-point outing, and he totaled 21 such outings through 26 games. Furthermore, the NBA legend went on play in all 82 games that season and finished with otherworldly averages for a rookie: 28.2 points, 6.5 rebounds, 5.9 assists, and 2.4 steals per game.
That said, Michael Jordan was 21 years old at the time. Paolo Banchero and Zion Williamson didn't reach No. 20 until their 26th game, but they did so well before turning 21.
Due to a late start to his rookie year after recovering from a knee injury, Williamson's 26th game and 20th 20-point performance didn't come until two games into his sophomore NBA season.
As for Banchero, he looks well on his way to joining Jordan as an NBA Rookie of the Year. The 20-year-old Seattle native is averaging 21.9 points, 6.9 rebounds, 4.0 assists, and 1.0 steals for an Orlando Magic squad that has won seven of its past eight games.
The Magic (12-21), who have been without former Duke basketball big man Wendell Carter Jr. (foot) for a month but expect his return next time out, host the San Antonio Spurs (10-20) and NBA Blue Devil Tre Jones at 7 p.m. ET Friday.

Or maybe not.

As it is, though, it sounds like neither Lively nor Whitehead, who arrived in Durham this summer at No. 1 and No. 2 on the 247Sports 2022 Composite, would have been anywhere near 100 percent had they made the trip to Winston-Salem.
First-year Duke basketball head coach Jon Scheyer suggested to the media afterward that they were far from tip-top shape, leading to both staying home with a non-COVID illness.
""Really, [on Monday night], we were holding out hope that they could still play and give us some minutes,"" Scheyer explained. ""And they just weren't in a position to help us, and we didn't want to put them in harm's way either. So they've been out the last few days, not being able to practice...
""They got just the sick bug the last couple of days. Unfortunate.""
Now, the Blue Devils have 10 days to return to full strength before hosting the Florida State Seminoles at 1 p.m. ET on Dec. 31.
Scheyer implied that Dereck Lively II and Dariq Whitehead, who missed a combined four games in November while recovering from a calf injury and fractured foot, respectively, aren't likely to miss any more outings as a result of their illness.
""We feel they'll be back to practice when we return from Christmas — from Winter Break,"" Scheyer said.

https://www.si.com/college/duke/basketball/duke-basketball-center-rebounding-embarrassing,Duke big man calls rebounding effort 'embarrassing',"An 8-for-27 shooting clip from deep isn't ideal. And neither is a 26-14 free throw disparity in the opponent's favor. But perhaps the overriding factor in Duke basketball's 81-70 road loss to the unranked Wake Forest Demon Deacons (9-4, 1-1 ACC) on Tuesday night was the missing extra effort in corralling rebounds and loose balls.
The shorthanded No. 14 Blue Devils (10-3, 1-1 ACC) fell short in the rebounding battle, 37-29, leading to their many comeback attempts falling short.
It was only the third time this season that Duke, which entered the game at No. 5 among all 363 Division I teams in average rebounding margin (+11.0), grabbed fewer boards than its opponent. Now, two of those three outings have resulted in losses.
As for the other occurrence, it came in a 75-59 home win over the Boston College Eagles on Dec. 3, meaning the Blue Devils, while still rebounding well on the season as a whole, are now 0-2 in rebounding battles in ACC play.
""It's inexcusable,"" graduate center Ryan Young, who finished with 10 points and nine boards as an admirably aggressive fill-in starter for one of two rookies out with illness in Dereck Lively II, said about the negative rebounding margin. ""It's toughness, and it's effort. It's not much else that goes into rebounding, and we know that.
""We take pride in that being a strength of ours. And it was embarrassing that we couldn't win that tonight. And as [head coach Jon Scheyer] mentioned, I felt like it was all effort, and they out-toughed us, and they came out right from the jump and wanted it more than us.""
Speaking of Scheyer, the loss was only the program's third to Wake Forest since his junior year as a Duke basketball guard in 2008-09; the Blue Devils have 23 wins in the series during that stretch.
Although the first-year Duke basketball head coach mentioned that it didn't help to be without Lively and freshman small forward Dariq Whitehead (also out with a non-COVID illness), he too noted that the overall effort level wasn't sufficient following his team's 10-day span since its last game.
""Being in this environment, playing shorthanded, we played without our full team in about half our games or whatever it is,"" Scheyer explained. ""You have to keep perspective, but you also have to hate the result. That's part of what makes you a competitor, whether it's as a coach or as a player.
""And so for us, I think it's important understanding the room we have to grow, and we just have to keep going. And also, we need to address the things that we need to cut out now because there's a sense of urgency. In the ACC, you have to win these games. You have to come back and win against Florida State. You have to win on the road.""
Duke hosts the Seminoles at 1 p.m. ET on Dec. 31 before playing back-to-back road games against the NC State Wolfpack and Boston College Eagles the following week.

Duke has won four straight. Meanwhile, the Demon Deacons have lost three of their past four outings but are undefeated at home this season and 1-0 against teams currently in the AP Top 25.

For the second straight week, four ACC teams appear in the poll. The other three are the Virginia Cavaliers (8-1, 1-0 ACC) at No. 6, the Virginia Tech Hokies (11-1, 1-0 ACC) at No. 21, and the Miami Hurricanes (11-1, 2-0 ACC) at No. 22.

The 6-foot-6, 195-pound four-star, who ranks No. 48 overall on the 247Sports 2024 Composite and in October joined Jeremy Roach and Trevor Keels as the third Paul VI (Va.) talent to commit to the Blue Devils in the past four years, knocked down only one of the five ""money balls.""
And since his final attempt did not beat the buzzer, he technically went 15-for-24, including at least two makes from each of the five spots. Have a look at Harris' smoothly polished, consistent stroke around the arc:
In Saturday's 76-27 opening-round victory over Canterbury (Fla.) at the City of Palms Classic, Harris scored only 10 points, shooting 4-for-11 from the field and 2-for-6 from downtown, with Duke basketball head coach Jon Scheyer and assistant Amile Jefferson sitting courtside. But he played only 16 minutes in the blowout.
Harris, arguably the nation's premier 3-point shooter in high school right now, next takes the floor at 5:15 p.m. ET Monday when Paul VI plays a quarterfinal matchup against Lake Highlands (Texas), featuring five-star 2024 Duke basketball offer-holder Tre Johnson in the backcourt.
Suppose Paul VI wins and Christopher Columbus (Fla.) defeats Myers Park (N.C.) in the next quarterfinal game. If so, at 5 p.m. ET Tuesday, Darren Harris would battle against the heralded Boozer twins, Cayden and Cameron, the sons of Blue Devil great Carlos Boozer and two of only three 2025 prospects with Duke offers in hand.

As a program, Duke hasn't lost a ""true road game"" since Jan. 18, when the 2021-22 Blue Devils fell to the Florida State Seminoles in overtime, 79-78. Then they reeled off wins in their last eight road outings, all in ACC play.
Now, entering the bout at Wake Forest, those eight straight mark the longest active road win streak among all 363 Division I teams, according to a Sunday tweet from the official account for Duke basketball stats. Next on the list are the Miami Hurricanes and Stephen F. Austin Lumberjacks in a tie with seven straight apiece.
Although the Demon Deacons have struggled of late, losing three of their past four games, it's worth noting they are 6-0 at home this season. And their only matchup against a team that is currently ranked resulted in a 78-75 road win over the now-No. 22 Wisconsin Badgers as part of the ACC-Big Ten Challenge in late November.
