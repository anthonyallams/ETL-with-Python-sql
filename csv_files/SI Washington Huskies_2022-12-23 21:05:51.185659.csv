He carried such a big, athletic frame, his University of Washington football coaches initially weren't sure whether to use him as an edge rusher or a down lineman, certain only they would somehow get him on the field as much as possible.
Don James' staff finally ended up letting Reggie Rogers try both positions — and this worked out so well, going from one to the other, he ended up as the seventh player taken overall in the 1987 NFL draft.
Kalen DeBoer and his Husky coaches now face the same intriguing situation with another James, this one incoming freshman Anthony James II, a 6-foot-5, 265-pound signee from Wylie, Texas, and considered the prize of their latest recruiting class.
This teenaged James is an inch shorter yet 30 pounds heavier than Rogers when the latter, a scholarship UW basketball player from Sacramento, California, first decided to become a two-sport athlete at the college level and, once he was wildly successful at it, a football player only.
Anthony James will report to the UW not long after the Huskies play in next week's Alamo Bowl against the Texas Longhorns in San Antonio, which is 300 miles from his suburban Dallas hometown. He practically could hitch a ride to Montlake on the team charter jet. 
For now, James will arrive in town as an edge rusher and let everything play out. 
""We'll see how that weight goes on and, if it goes on fast, then you kind of have to figure out what happens next,"" DeBoer said of James possibly becoming an inside lineman. ""We'll see how his body just reacts to a full year-round program at the college level. I think the sky's the limit for him no matter where he lines up.""
Rogers, who struggled with substance-abuse issues and was involved in a fatal auto accident when intoxicated that sent him to prison, was maybe five miles from Husky Stadium when he died in 2013 at 49. Gone for a decade now, he was seated on a Central District porch when his body gave out. It was a sad, unfortunate end to a somewhat legendary UW football player.
In 1984, the Huskies put the then 6-foot-6, 235-pound Rogers at edge rusher, officially designating him as an outside linebacker, and he got off to a very promising college football beginning. Rogers responded with 10 tackles for loss, which included 5 sacks, for an 11-1 team that beat Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl.
However, Rogers was moved to defensive tackle the following season. He was able to put on considerable weight with ease. He was up to 260 pounds on his long, sturdy frame when he changed defensive positions and increased his totals to 15 TFLs and 8 sacks. 
In 1986, as a second-year DT, Rogers came up with another 13 TFLs and 7 sacks, and the Detroit Lions had to have him. He left the UW as a consensus All-America selection and the then Pac-10's Morris Trophy winner as the conference's top lineman.
Anthony James is a much bigger body in these more modern times of weight training and strength conditioning — already up to 265 pounds — but the current UW coaching staff still initially sees an edge rusher in him.
""That's definitely where you start him out,"" DeBoer said. ""That's what his body is. He's a big edge for sure.""
While Rogers was a late bloomer to football, James has been highly thought of all along, initially committing to Texas A&M before re-opening his recruiting. He thrust himself into a leadership role with the Huskies once he committed, doing all he could to get other leading prospects to join him in Seattle.
In fact, he'll be one of the first of the newcomers to show up for UW winter conditioning, setting yet another example for others to follow. He's mature beyond his years. And he wants to be as good as he can be.
DeBoer, on signing day, made sure to salute James for his early efforts in promoting Husky football, helping the first-year coach further solidify his program.
""He was one of the guy I think who really rallied our recruiting class from the beginning, back in the summer — an exceptional player, can't wait to get him on the football field,"" the Husky coach said. ""Just who he is, and his focus and intensity, who continued to make our recruiting class great, was certainly noticeable.""

https://www.si.com/college/washington/football/one-of-the-uw-season-successes-was-ztfs-willingness-to-adjust,One of the UW Season Successes Was ZTF's Willingness to Adjust,"The Husky edge rusher came off the bench, which was unusual for him when healthy.
Zion Tupuola-Fetui at first felt inadequate. He'd been a first-team All-Pac-12 edge rusher, a third-team AP All-America selection, the national leader in sacks per game and a first-round pick in more than mock draft.
Yet for this season, his fifth at the University of Washington, the new coaching staff asked him to come off the bench, to be a back-up player, to assume a lesser role than he was accustomed.
So how did that go?
""I'm thinking I'm not that good at the time,"" the player known as ZTF confided.
However, the 6-foot-4, 245-pound defensive stalwart from Pearl City, Hawaii, proved to be one of the biggest positives in a 10-2 Husky season that had an overabundance of them.
After a couple of games of floundering around and suffering through an identity crisis, Tupuola-Fetui pushed his pride aside, made his ego behave itself and adjusted to what was initially an uncomfortable situation. 
He didn't pout, get angry or lash out. He did what he was asked to do, willingly and enthusiastically, which was to play fewer snaps and make them count just the same.
While this Husky reserve duty was basically new to him again, with 6-foot-4, 267-pound sophomore Bralen Trice and 6-foot-4, 269-pound senior Jeremiah Martin taking the field first and for longer stretches, ZTF quickly discovered evidence that not everyone viewed him any different.
""As soon as I came in, I see the quarterback, the tackle and the center check protection for me,"" he said. ""So there's still like benefits to that.""
The big Hawaiian played with his usual unbridled enthusiasm, foremost in the Apple Cup in Pullman when he tackled Washington State quarterback Cam Ward for a sack, got to his feet and feigned planting a flag into the artificial turf, which is what the Cougars did for real the year before in Seattle. 
Most of all, Tupuola-Fetui had to push the defensive numbers aside. In 2020, in just over four pandemic outings in empty stadiums, he piled up with 7 sacks in the silence, including 3 that were strip sacks, to draw all sorts of college football attention.
Whereas people wondered if he might enter the NFL draft following those heroics, ZTF tore an Achilles tendon that required surgery and delayed his start in 2021, played five games and suffered a season-ending concussion. He had a solitary sack last season as the Huskies imploded and went 4-8 and Jimmy Lake got fired as coach well before the mess was over.
""I just had to take a step back and, maybe not from a numbers perspective, look at the game,"" ZTF said. ""It was, 'Oh, Bralen's got this and I've got nothing.' Or 'Miah's got this and I've got just half of that.' It was just understanding the impact I was making coming off the bench.""
The new UW edge-rusher rotation worked out far better than anyone could have imagined. Sometimes the coaching staff used all three of these guys at the same time.
Martin and Trice, finishing third in the league with 8.5 and 8 sacks, respectively, each were rewarded as first-team, All-Pac-12 selections, as voted by the coaches. ZTF, with 4.5 sacks to finish 12th in the conference, even picked up honorable-mention accolades.
""Once I was able to see the bigger picture instead of focusing on myself in that way,"" he said, ""it was, yeah, it was real easy to come off the bench and be there for my brothers.""
As everyone gets ready for the Alamo Bowl and a game against Texas, Martin is ready to play his final college outing, while Trice and ZTF have announced their return for 2023., expecting to be side-by-side starters rather than manning the same position. They expressed their desire to be ""the Best Pass Rush Duo in the Nation.""
While ZTF might have been humbled some, he chalks off this past season's playing assignment as something that was necessary for the good of the team, which he made work to everyone's satisfaction. 
That said, he's lost none of his confidence or any faith in his playmaking ability.
""Different role, for sure,"" he said. ""I'm also expecting a different role for next year.""

https://www.si.com/college/washington/recruiting/huskies-draw-top-national-recruiting-ranking-from-siaa,UW Draws Top National Recruiting Ranking from SI All-American,"A late push by Kalen DeBoer's staff brought top 25 recognition.
Kalen DeBoer sat down in front of media members and expressed his deep satisfaction with how well his 2023 University of Washington football recruiting class had turned out.
Glancing at social-media posts, Husky followers couldn't contain themselves with how giddy they were over the more than two-dozen signees announced.
So with the head coach and the fan base signing off on it, how will did these UW recruiters fare with the various national analysts?
Of the four leading organizations weighing in and sizing up this annual college football talent grab, SI All-American supplied the Huskies with their highest grade in its Top 25 ranking — pegging them 22nd, which was two slots higher than next-best slot for DeBoer and Company.
Of the others, Rivals.com came next and slotted the UW 23rd while both CBSSports.com and On3.com ranked the Huskies in 27th place.
John Garcia, director of football recruiting for SI All-American, whose story you can read here, acknowledged the late work accomplished by the Huskies in coming up with a number grade for them.
""Another program working well in December, Washington continued that momentum Wednesday in keeping Caleb Presley home. The longtime Oregon Duck commitment was the sole ounce of negative news coming out of Eugene. Locking in wide receiver Taeshaun Lyons days earlier also stands out with UW recruiting down the stretch.""
For those wondering what it might have taken to elevate the Huskies even more, the late commitment flip of South Dakota quarterback Lincoln Kienholz from the UW to Ohio State no doubt held them back some.
Signing quarterbacks always carry a lot of weight in these sort of rankings — and the DeBoer's staff chose to go without one for this recruiting cycle once Kienholz moved on from his Montlake commitment. 
The late pick-up of Presley, a 4-star cornerback, Washington state's No. 1 overall recruit and a commitment flip from Oregon back to the UW, no doubt had a big impact in the Huskies rubbing elbows with the others in SIAA's Top 25. 
Of the other Pac-12 teams identified in Garcia's national listing, Oregon ranked sixth, USC 13th and Utah 24th.

https://www.si.com/college/washington/football/understated-as-can-be-mcmillan-confirms-hes-returning-for-2023,"Understated As Can Be, McMillan Confirms He's Returning for 2023","The Husky wide receiver lets the world know with eight words.
No surprise video, no splashy graphic, just eight words.
On Thursday, wide receiver Jalen McMillan used a rather understated approach to let everyone know he would return to the University of Washington football team in 2023.
""I'm coming back for next year. Go huskies,"" he posted on Twitter, feeling no compulsion whatsoever to capitalize the H in his team name.
He was simply done with his decision, ready to move on to the Alamo Bowl game against Texas and then maybe seek another 1,000-yard receiving season.
Eight words and out.
With that disclosure, McMillan joined his quarterback Michael Penix Jr., edge rushers Zion Tupuola-Fetui and Bralen Trice, defensive tackle Tuli Letuligasenoa and offensive tackle Troy Fautanu as UW players with varying degrees of NFL potential, but potential just the same, choosing to use one more season of college football eligibility. 
All that's left is McMillan's bookend receiver — Rome Odunze — to declare his intentions.
McMillan, while leading the Huskies with 71 receptions, and ranking behind only Arizona's Jacob Cowing and Odunze in the Pac-12 with 5.92 catches per game, remains one of the most overlooked players at the FBS level.
The 6-foot-1, 186-pound sophomore from Fresno, California, received no attention when the preseason listings came out. 
Even after adding 1,040 yards and 8 scores to his ample catch total, the best McMillan could do in terms of All-Pac-12 accolades handed out by the conference coaches was receive honorable-mention recognition. 
So he's coming back. Needing only eight words to let everyone know. Maybe working on a longer acceptance speech for another day.

https://www.si.com/college/washington/football/ranking-the-husky-cornerbacks-assembled-after-adding-5-new-ones,Ranking the Husky Cornerbacks Assembled After Adding 5 New Ones,"We look at 11 potential candidates for the two starting jobs.
When the University of Washington football team played struggling Arizona State in early October, the Huskies actually were the shorthanded ones that day in the desert.
Kalen DeBoer's staff had to dig deep to find someone to play cornerback. 
Both starters were out or less than 100 percent because of injuries. Multiple freshmen took the field that day, with Elijah Jackson making his first UW start and another, Davon Banks, coming up with his first career interception.
However, the Huskies were easy pickings, even for back-up Sun Devils quarterback Trenton Bourguet, who wound up taking ASU down the field late for a game-deciding score and a 45-38 victory. This fill-in player made it happen by throwing over and over again at the UW cornerbacks.
DeBoer vowed this wouldn't happen again, that his Huskies wouldn't be forced to scramble to find an experienced player at any one position group, especially at corner — a responsibility that in essence acts like a safety harness so a football team doesn't fall off the mountain.
The Huskies feel they satisfied this need by going out and securing five new cornerbacks, all with fairly heady credentials. It's a group that consists of Jabbar Muhammad from Oklahoma State, the state's No. 1 recruit in Caleb Presley, a touted Louisiana prospect who advertises himself as Curley ""Lockdown"" Reed, a California find in Leroy Bryant and a SoCal battled-tested JC player in Thaddeus Dixon.
""That's a phenomenal group,"" DeBoer said in his Wednesday signing-day briefing.
To try and survive this past season, UW coaches started five different cornerbacks in sophomore Mishael Powell, grad transfer Jordan Perryman from UC Davis, converted junior safety Julius Irvin, Jackson and Banks, and nearly started true freshman Jaivion Green while still playing him a lot.
Powell and Perryman missed several games with injuries, with the latter never looking quite right, or at least not nearly as efficient as he was when going up against Rome Odunze during spring football practice. Irvin and Banks suffered season-ending injuries. Jackson was a late-season complement because of his own health issues.
Throw all of these names together into a hat, new and old, including redshirt freshman Dyson McCutcheon, who flipped back and forth between corner and the hybrid Husky defender, and subtract the soon to depart Perryman, and you have 11 names competing for two jobs.
DeBoer and his Husky staff seem to have indicated to everyone that jobs are there to be had.
""I think all of those guys, including the safeties, are mature for their age,"" said the UW coach, who signed two of the latter this time. ""[They're] guys that we've challenged to come in and really, you immediately know we need some depth, but come in with the intention to really push hard, whatever that role may be, but pushing hard to get on the football field next year and help us out.""
Not to point fingers, but harsh reality here is most of the holdovers didn't often show a great break on the football, which is the true mark of a great cornerback. 
A most telling stat: whereas Muhammad had 9 pass break-ups for Oklahoma State this season, the entire Husky cornerback corps came up with a combined 6 break-ups over 12 regular-season games, with Irvin, the converted safety and just a six-game player before getting injured, topping those guys with 2.
With all of that in mind, we look at the Huskies' 11 cornerback candidates, barring any transfer-portal exits or position changes, who should come to spring football practice and be ready to compete like they never have before. 
We currently list these players in order of reputation or previous production. 
RANKING THE CORNERBACKS
1) Jabbar Muhammad, 5-10, 175, Jr. — He comes to Seattle from Oklahoma State, where he played in 31 games and started 13, opening all 12 this season. The Texas native has 13 career PBUs and one career interception. He's been in the mix and shown results. He  should be considered as a leading candidate to join the No. 1 defense. 
2) Mishael Powell, 6-1, 204, Jr. — The former walk-on from Seattle has played in 20 career Husky games, starting 10, including seven this season. He had no defensive passing stats during this past regular season for DeBoer's staff but came up with 3 PBUs in 2021. If healthy, he stands a good chance to retain his starting role.
3) Caleb Presley, 6-0, 180, Fr. — He's considered the state's No. 1 recruit at any position and flipped his commitment from Oregon, which is what safety Budda Baker did in 2014 for the Huskies. Local guy. No. 1 guy. Left the Ducks at the alter. A Seattle native, Presley should push for immediate playing time, if not a starting job.   
4) Curley Reed, 6-1, 180, Fr. — This Louisiana 4-star prospect missed all but one game of his junior year with a knee injury, which might have kept some of the powerhouse FBS schools from pursuing him. He played as a recovered and confident senior in coming up with 15 PBUs and 2 interceptions, and likewise should push for game time or even starting, same as Presley.
5) Thaddeus Dixon, 6-0, 187, Jr. — He comes to the Huskies from Long Beach City College, where he came up with 5 interceptions in two seasons as a starter. Considering his junior-college experience, this California native should be in the mix for playing time right off the bat. 
6) Davon Banks, 5-11, 185, So. — He showed himself to be a playmaker at times, but got picked on all season by opposing teams, and even gave up the game-winner at Arizona State. He started twice in eight outings before going down with an injury. He had 2 PUBs and an interception at ASU. The concern here is whether he comes out of the season unscathed or as damaged goods. 
7) Leroy Bryant, 6-0, 175, Fr. — A superior all-round athlete, Bryant was named Player of the Year in his northern California high school conference. He caught 58 passes on offense, showing his athleticism. He's considered a sleeper among all of these cornerback candidates, and could leapfrog a lot of players if true.
8) Jaivion Green, 6-2, 202, So. — He played in nine games as a true freshman where it might have been better had he redshirted. While gaining valuable experience, he got picked on as well and gave up multiple touchdown passes, including a deep one to Colorado. He had a PBU and a big hit against Stanford, but it almost seems like he's built to play safety.
9) Elijah Jackson, 6-1, 184, So. — He got on the field late this season due to injury, started against both Arizona schools and appeared in six games overall. He had a forced fumble, but no defensive passing stats. It's unclear if his nine career Husky appearances will keep him from getting passed over by the impressive newcomers or give him an edge over them. 
10) Julius Irvin, 6-1, 179, Sr. — We rank him this low only because he's a natural safety and likely to return there because of the influx of talent. Still, he's the son of one of the greatest NFL corners ever, LeRoy Irvin. He played cornerback because of a manpower emergency, started four games, and then was lost for the season because of injury. He appended himself well while in there with a pass theft and his 2 PBUs. 
11) Dyson McCutcheon, 5-11, 178, So. — Again, he ranks low here only because he spent a good portion of the regular season at the hybrid Husky spot seemingly more than at corner. He appeared in five games and had a PBU. Of course, he hails from a well-known NFL family, as well.

https://www.si.com/college/washington/recruiting/huskies-add-another-corner-in-oklahoma-states-muhammad,"Huskies Add Another Corner, Sign Oklahoma State's Muhammad","He's the fifth new player in that UW position group.
Before they could turn their full attention to Texas and the Alamo Bowl, Kalen DeBoer's University of Washington coaches on Thursday signed another player in former Oklahoma State cornerback Jabbar Muhammad.
He's someone who knows how to beat the Longhorns, having been on the positive side of a 41-34 victory over Steve Sarkisian's team in Stillwater on October 8 — the same day the Huskies lost their last game, 45-38 to Arizona State on the road.
The 5-foot-10, 175-pound Muhammad is the fifth cornerback to join this UW recruiting class, and the most ready to play of the bunch. This  group includes high school signees in Caleb Presley from Seattle, Curley Reed from Lake Charles, Louisiana, and Leroy Bryant from Fairfield, California, plus SoCal junior-college addition Thaddeus Dixon.
USA TODAY Sports
Clearly this was the position most in need of an upgrade for the DeBoer staff after the Huskies' All-Pac-12 selections Trent McDuffie and Kyler Gordon entered the NFL draft a year ago and left the new coaching staff with largely untested players.
Muhammad, a junior from DeSoto, Texas, is the 26th signee for the UW. He comes to the Huskies after he started every game for Oklahoma State (7-5) and had a breakout season with 48 tackles, 9 pass break-ups, an interception and a forced fumble. He played in 31 games overall, and knocked down 13 passes. He has two seasons of eligibility remaining.
He leaves a team that won six of its first seven games before tailing off badly and dropping four of its final five, which led to him and nine other Cowboys players to head for the transfer portal. 
Muhammad drew his first Oklahoma State start a year ago in the Fiesta Bowl and he was a standout in a 37-35 victory over Notre Dame, collecting 8 tackles and a pair of pass break-ups.
By entering the the portal, Muhammad passed up the Cowboys' postseason game, the Guaranteed Rate Bowl against Wisconsin on Dec. 27 in Phoenix.

https://www.si.com/college/washington/basketball/frigid-huskies-dont-stnad-a-chance-against-auburn,"Frigid Huskies Can't Come in from the Cold, Lose to Auburn","The home team turns in a disappointing outing against the SEC team.
The 23rd-ranked Auburn basketball team wore all-white game uniforms, was backed by the most vocal section of fans in the arena and never trailed, not once. 
One might have thought this non-conference encounter was played in the heart of the South.
No, just south of University Village, but the Washington Huskies still treated it as a foreign and unfriendly environment, losing 84-61 to their SEC visitors from Alabama on Wednesday night at Alaska Airlines Arena.
On a cold evening in the Northwest, the Huskies (9-4 overall, 1-1 Pac-12) brought the chill inside while running up and down their home court without much creativity at all. 
Even with a decent crowd of UW fans on hand for this intersectional match-up, sharing the place with those vocal Auburn followers, the guys in the all-purple threads simply were miserable on offense. It was a huge letdown for all involved.
The Huskies didn't score their first basket until five and a half minutes were played — and it came on freshman guard Koren Johnson's driving lay-in while using his wrong hand against the Tigers (10-2).
The locals hit the 10-minute mark of the first half with seven points and just two field goals made, making it abundantly clear it was going to be a long night for Mike Hopkins' team. 
We let bad offense affect our defense and we can't allow that to happen,"" the coach said.
Joe Nicholson/USA TODAY Sports
Not even the presence of offensive-minded Husky quarterback Michael Penix Jr., the nation's leading passer who occupied a front-row seat at midcourt next to leading one of the UW's top donors, could inspire his basketball brethren to get anything going in terms of putting the ball in the basket. 
Hey, even current football coach Kalen DeBoer and former UW leader Chris Petersen, plus former Husky point guard Isaiah Thomas were in the house, but still nothing resembling any consistent point production was apparent all game.
As the opening half wound down, the Huskies fell behind by 15, at 27-12 and 29-14, before scrambling to pull within 29-23 on Johnson's three-point play with 22 seconds left before the break and settling for a 31-23 deficit when it came. 
Auburn's 6-foot-8 senior forward Jaylin Williams provided nearly half of his team's first-half points with 14 while working unchecked inside and finished tied for game honors with 6-foot-10 sophomore teammate Johni Broome, both with 18 points.
The Huskies had no one with more than 5 points at that juncture, a total shared by the aforementioned Johnson and one-time SEC player Keion Brooks.
To that point, the stat-keepers' job was fairly straightforward: just track the misses. Over the first 20 minutes, the UW shot a frigid 7 for 33 from the field, or a lifeless 21.2 percent, and 2 for 13 from behind the line.
Maybe trying too hard, Brooks might have had his worst outing in Montlake, at least half, while facing the SEC that he had left behind. On this night, he hit just 2 of 9 first-half shots before getting untracked and coming up with a team-best 15 points.
At intermission, colorful Auburn coach Bruce Pearl couldn't have been faulted if he had the team's charter bus idling outside the arena, ready for a quick getaway with the outcome fairly obvious.
With the Huskies down 25 at the five-minute mark, fans began leaving the arena in large numbers. 
This team doesn't play again until Dec. 30 when it hosts USC, which Auburn 74-71 recently in Los Angeles, in Alaska Airlines Arena. Maybe it will find some offense by then.

https://www.si.com/college/washington/recruiting/how-huskies-got-germie-bernard-to-return-to-the-program,How the Huskies Got Germie Bernard to Return to the Program,"All Kalen DeBoer's football coaching staff had to do was ask.
Wide receiver Jeremy ""Germie"" Bernard was in the transfer portal and the University of Washington coaching staff thought why not?
Kalen DeBoer and his recruiters felt compelled to reach out to a player who had signed with the Huskies 12 months earlier, even showed up in Seattle to enroll early in UW classes with snow on the ground and bolted when holdover receivers coach Junior Adams chose to take another job at Oregon.
Just days on the job at the UW, DeBoer had taken a home visit to Las Vegas to introduce himself to a player considered his No. 1 recruit and to try his best to keep him headed to the UW, even with the coaching change. It worked for awhile.
Bernard ultimately broke it all off and signed with Michigan State, yet DeBoer remembered there was a connection between the kid and the school he had seen.
""When you know you've got a chance, and he was a guy who really loved the program from the get-go, and I felt that a year ago,"" DeBoer said. ""It wasn't just about the coaching staff. He loved Washington. He loved this program.""
So the Huskies — who didn't have a receivers coach after Bernard arrived in Seattle — put the ever personable JaMarcus Shephard, Adams' replacement, on this one-time but oh so brief Husky to do his persuasive recruitment and soon they had this player called Germie back in the fold.
""I think there's a piece when he's ready to leave [Michigan State], you can't help but at least ask and find out where this is going to go and what the thought process is,"" DeBoer said. ""He was all about looking at the U-Dub.""
Shephard certainly was a compelling reason for him to retrace his steps once they got acquainted. Yet another was proof of the Husky offensive prowess with this new staff rather than take a flier on a promise. A pair of 1,000-yard receivers had to be a strong selling point. So was the Huskies' 39-28 victory over Michigan State in September with Bernard playing against the Huskies that day.
""I think a lot of it is Jeremy seeing what we did offensively,"" DeBoer said, ""and he can see his role in it, not just next year, but in the years to come.""

https://www.si.com/college/washington/recruiting/huskies-welcome-25-new-players-on-sign-day,"Huskies Welcome 25 New Players, Could Add a Couple More","Kalen DeBoer's staff goes heavy on cornerbacks, finding four new ones.
A year ago, when Kalen DeBoer sat down to discuss his first University of Washington football recruiting class, he unveiled five names. That was it.
He talked in great detail about wide receivers Germie Bernard and Denzel Boston, tight end Ryan Otton, edge rusher Lance Holtzclaw and offensive guard Parker Brailsford, all players initially recruited by Jimmy Lake's departed staff.
DeBoer, on the job for just a couple weeks back then, had hired two assistant coaches and a recruiting coordinator.
What a difference a solid year of showing off a remade program, glowing 10-2 season, Alamo Bowl invitation against Texas and the nation's leading passing attack can make.
On Wednesday, DeBoer revealed a 25-player group of high school, portal transfer and junior-college signees, a collection of new faces so great he had to summarize by position groups rather than speak about each newcomer individually — and suggested it could grow by two more.
The Husky coach welcomed 18 high school players and another seven transfers, including a very late portal addition in Arizona State back-up running back Daniyel Ngata, whose brother Ariel previously was once an inside linebacker for the Huskies.
Considering what happened to the UW over the course of the season, with deep balls continually flying over players' heads for touchdowns, DeBoer's staff went cornerback heavy. The Huskies picked up three from the high school ranks in Caleb Presley, Curley Reed and Leroy Bryant, plus a California junior-college addition in Thaddeus Dixon.
""That's a phenomenal group,"" DeBoer said. ""I can't be more excited about that group.""
Considered the state's No. 1 prospect, Presley flipped his commitment from Oregon to the UW, stemming the flow at least for now of top Washington players going elsewhere.
""It's a really cool thing for him to stay home,"" DeBoer said.
The Huskies brought in five defensive backs in all, counting safeties Vincent Holmes and Diesel Gordon, and could add one more.
The breakdown was 14 new defensive players, 11 of the offense.
As many as a dozen will be involved in spring practice, too. 
The Huskies picked up five new offensive linemen, a group that DeBoer said compares favorably to the high-end players he inherited.
He picked up three wide receivers, including Bernard, who signed last year, traveled to Seattle to enroll early and asked for his scholarship release once receivers coach Junior Adams left for Oregon and the Nevada pass catcher played his freshman year at Michigan State.
DeBoer said Bernard left after getting caught up in the coaching changes, but always liked the UW, and was even more so when saw what the offense did for the wide receivers. 
Another receiver, Taeshaun Lyons from Hayward, California, was a late commit but didn't sign yesterday. There's no indication he won't.
Ngata is one of two ASU players to leave the desert for the UW following the Sun Devils coaching change, joining edge rusher/down lineman Joe Moore III in Montlake. A full-service back, he rushed 136 times for 689 yards and 6 touchdowns, scoring one of them in his team's 45-38 win over the Huskies. He also casught 9 passes for 54 yards and returned 18 kickoffs for 411 yards, including a 58-yarder against Utah.
DeBoer credited edge rusher Anthony James II from Wylie, Texas, with helping jumpstart this recruiting class, with his commitment really opening doors for UW recruiters. The coach said James, who will arrive in Seattle in a few weeks to get started, is capable of playing both edge and interior line, but it's a matter of how much weight he can play at.
One position the Huskies didn't fulfill was quarterback. They had a new one in South Dakota's Lincoln Kienholz, but he flipped to Ohio State in the process, so the UW went without one this cycle.
They have three on the roster in starter Michael Penix Jr. and his back-ups in Dylan Morris and Sam Huard, with the latter two not offering any indications they're thinking of leaving. 
""I think we're comfortable with three,"" DeBoer said. ""I'd be more comfortable with four. But we don't need to just take a quarterback.""
While the Huskies need to meet the 85-player scholarship limit, DeBoer said his team is close and expects further roster attrition.

https://www.si.com/college/washington/football/jumper-reportedly-becomes-fifth-uw-player-to-enter-transfer-portal,Jumper Reportedly Becomes Fifth UW Player to Enter Transfer Portal,"The redshirt freshman tight end was compared to Will Dissly by former coach Jimmy Lake.
Caden Jumper was going to be another Will Dissly.
That's what Jimmy Lake promised exactly two years ago on signing day. Of course, Lake also suggested that he was going to be the University of Washington football coach for longer than 13 games, too.
Demonstrating how one player might fit one coaching staff's vision but not another, Jumper on Wednesday entered the transfer portal, according to multiple reports, beginning with 247Sports and followed by The Athletic. 
The 6-foot-3, 253-pound Jumper from Eatonville, Washington, at the base of Mount Rainier, didn't seem long for Kalen DeBoer's program because he was more of a power-oriented than a finesse tight end, which is what the Grubb/DeBoer offense demands.
A redshirt freshman, Jumper recently made his first Husky game-day appearance, drawing snaps at the end of the UW's 54-7 victory over Colorado. Previously, he traveled for the first time but didn't play at California, a move necessitated by injuries to others.
Asked if Jumper had been making a breakthrough to land on the Cal trip, offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb said no, only that he needed another body.  
Lake had a totally different view of this rangy player, using his Dissly comparison for Jumper in December 2020 while announcing the new Huskies.
""This guy is one of the tougher guys I've seen on film,"" the former UW coach said at the time. ""What you guys should think about is Will Dissly. That's Caden Jumper. ... He'll mash people on the run game and release and make big-time catches.""
Instead, Jumper becomes the fifth UW player to enter the portal since the regular season ended, joining junior safety Cam Williams (Georgia Southern), redshirt freshman cornerback Zakhari Spears (Connecticut), redshirt freshman defensive tackle Kuao Peihopa (Hawaii) and redshirt freshman wide receiver Lonyatta Alexander Jr.
