Defensive back John Saunders Jr. out of Miami (OH) has committed to the Rebels, he announced on Friday.
Mississippi State Bulldogs wide receiver Rara Thomas announced his decision to transfer to the Georgia Bulldogs on Thursday. He was courted on social media by various Ole Miss players after his decision to enter the portal.
The Ole Miss Rebels are reportedly one of a handful of teams that has been in communication with former No. 1 overall recruit Travis Hunter, who recently left Jackson State via the NCAA Transfer Portal. 
Colorado, who hired former Jackson State head coach Deion Sanders, along with the Georgia Bulldogs, are the two teams who seem to be in the lead for Sanders. 
But the Rebels are close behind. 
""According to sources, Hunter has had conversations with multiple staffers at Georgia, including Kirby Smart,"" On3's Chad Simmons said. ""Miami, Ole Miss, USC and some others are working to be considered, too. But Georgia and Colorado are the two to watch early.""
Hunter is an electric talent who plays on both sides of the ball at wide receiver and cornerback. 
Over the weekend, Ole Miss hosted Miami (Ohio) transfer prospect John Saunders. 
With multiple years of eligibility remaining, Saunders has started more than a dozen games at the FBS level. He has picked up five interceptions in that time. 
Saunders reported an offer from Ole Miss over the weekend after a trip his father referred to as ""special"" in his social media post. 
Former Texas A&M kicker Caden Davis officially announced Sunday that he would be transferring to Ole Miss. Davis will have two years of eligibility remaining with the SEC West program as a graduate transfer.
Davis was expected to replace Seth Small following the 2021 season. Instead, freshman Randy Bond took over full-time on field goals and point after attempts following Texas A&M's Week 2 loss against Appalachian State. Last season, Davis went 1 of 3 on field goal attempts, drilling a 40-yard kick in the season opener against Sam Houston. 
Ole Miss has landed a commitment from Joshua Harris, a transfer portal defensive lineman from NC State.
The first domino is in. 
The college football world knows Lane Kiffin will continue to attack the transfer portal and Thursday night was the setting for the first victory in that light. 
Jeremiah Jean-Baptiste, a 6-foot-2, 230-pound linebacker hailing from UCF, announced his commitment to the Ole Miss Rebels. It came on the heels of an official visit to Oxford. 
Jean-Baptiste has appeared in 35 UCF games in his collegiate career, meaning he has a single year of eligibility remaining for the 2023 season. The south Florida native capped his Knights career with 152 tackles, including 14 for loss, two sacks and an interception before making the transfer to the SEC.
Ole Miss brought in a UCF transfer last cycle, too, in wide receiver Jaylon Robinson. 
Ole Miss wide receiver Bralon Brown stated his intentions to enter the transfer portal on Tuesday afternoon.
Brown appeared in three games during the course of the 2022 season. 
A pair of former Missouri City (Texas) Fort Bend Marshall stars could be on the verge of making their next college step together -- and Ole Miss will host each for an official visit beginning Tuesday. 
Former Texas A&M wide receiver Chris Marshall, who saw playing time as a true freshman in 2022, has been coveted in the NCAA transfer portal. Likewise for his prep teammate and New Mexico safety Adari Haulcy, also expected in Oxford Tuesday. On3 was first to report the news of the latest Rebel transfer targets.
Marshall was an SI99 recruit in the 2022 class with plenty of options, and he produced in spot duty in the fall with 11 receptions for 108 yards as a freshman. Haulcy was one of the best players on the New Mexico roster, earning select freshman All-America honors with 87 tackles and two interceptions in 2022. 
Ole Miss defensive back Roman Rashada has entered the NCAA Transfer Portal after not seeing the field this fall. Rashada was signed out of JUCO during the offseason and was rated as a three-star recruit coming out of high school. 
Roman is the older brother of 2023 four-star quarterback Jaden Rashada. The younger Rashada brother is currently committed to the Miami Hurricanes after being recruited by Lane Kiffin over the summer.
Ole Miss offensive lineman Hamilton Hall has also declared his intention to enter the transfer portal. Hall was a redshirt senior this fall, appearing in only two games. The Atlanta, Ga., native was a three-star recruit in Ole Miss' 2018 signing class. 
Ole Miss defensive back Miles Battle announced his intention to enter the portal on Thursday.
Battle served as both a wide receiver and DB in his time with the Rebels.
Two more Ole Miss Rebels entered the NCAA Transfer Portal on Wednesday. Offensive lineman Jalen Cunningham and cornerback Kyndrich Breedlove have decided to test the transfer portal waters. 
Cunningham was a three-star recruit in Ole Miss' 2018 signing class and primarily served as a backup in his four seasons in Oxford.
Ole Miss has officially offered former Mississippi State receiver Rara Thomas. Thomas was the Bulldogs' leading receiver this fall bringing in 44 receptions, 626 receiving yards, and seven touchdowns. 
Lane Kiffin retweeted Thomas' transfer portal announcement on Friday and many other Ole Miss players commented on the post in an effort to convince the wideout to become a Rebel.
The Rebels could certainly use Thomas' deep-threat ability with senior receivers Jonathan Mingo and Malik Heath likely heading to the 2023 NFL Draft. Just like Thomas, Heath also spent his first two years playing for Mississippi State before deciding to enter the transfer portal in search of greener grass.
Could Ole Miss be in the process of landing another transfer wide receiver from the Mississippi State Bulldogs?
On Friday, Lane Kiffin retweeted an announcement from receiver Rara Thomas stating his intentions to enter the transfer portal.
It's worth noting that last offseason, the Rebels secured Malik Heath from the Bulldogs out of the portal as well. Heath was the leading receiver for Ole Miss this season in terms of yards, putting up 834 paired with four touchdowns.
Defensive back Derek Bermudez announced his intention to enter the transfer portal this week. The Jacksonville, Fla., native saw action in one game this season when the Rebels took on the Vanderbilt Commodores in Nashville.
The latest player to announce a departure from Ole Miss football is former in-state recruit MJ Daniels. 
The Lucedale, Miss. native is a sophomore defensive back who saw limited action in 2022 and appeared in five games as a true freshman in 2021. 
Daniels will have two seasons of eligibility remaining, as he outlined in his portal post on social media Wednesday. 
1. A third Monday portal entry has been announced by an Ole Miss player, this among the most anticipated in Luke Altmyer. From the moment he lost out on the quarterback battle, speculation surrounding the Starkville native has been steady. 
2. Not only did Baltimore native Demon Clowney announce his intent to hit the portal next month, but another running back did in Isaiah Woullard. 
Full story HERE.
3. The portal works both ways, and the 2022 season was evident in that regard for the Rebels. It's something Coordinator of Recruiting Strategy Kelvin Bolden reemphasized on Monday morning. 
Rebel reserve running back Kentrel Bullock, who was a part of a group of backs sitting behind the Quinshon Judkins-Zach Evans duo this fall, announced his departure from the future Ole Miss roster Sunday. 
More HERE. 
A reserve upperclassman from Montgomery, Ala., Brandon Mack has announced his plans to move on from Ole Miss. The defensive end made his move the day after the Egg Bowl defeat.

https://www.si.com/college/olemiss/football/ole-miss-rebels-texas-bowl-opponent-preview-texas-tech-red-raiders-offense,Ole Miss Rebels Texas Bowl Opponent Preview: Texas Tech Red Raiders Offense,"We wrap up our 2022 Ole Miss opponent previews with an overview of the Texas Tech offense.
HOUSTON, Tex. -- With the buzz of early signing day dying down, for now, it is time to preview the TaxAct Texas Bowl.
The Ole Miss Rebels have spent the last few weeks preparing to take on the Texas Tech Red Raiders in the Texas Bowl, their final game of the 2022 season.
The Rebels finished the regular season 8-4, and the Red Raiders finished 7-5. While Ole Miss had a brief quarterback competition at the beginning of the year between sophomores Luke Altmyer and Jaxson Dart, which ended with Dart winning the job, while Texas Tech had three quarterbacks operating under center throughout the season.
Sophomore Donovan Smith saw action in every game and led the Red Raiders in every passing category. Freshman Behren Morton played with Smith at the beginning of the year, and senior Tyler Shough paired up with Smith down the stretch. The Red Raiders are led by first-year coach Joey McGuire, who previously spent time as an associate head coach and linebackers coach with the Baylor Bears.
Ole Miss and Texas Tech have met six times since 1986, and the Rebels lead the series all-time with a 4-2 record. Their last meeting was in the 2018 season opener and the Rebels won 47-27.
Here is an overview of the Texas Tech offense Ole Miss will have to stop if it wants to secure its first victory in over a month. The Rebels and Red Raiders are set to kick off at 8 p.m. CT on Wednesday in NRG Stadium.
2022 Offensive Leaders
Passing: QB Donovan Smith
2022 stats: 1,505 passing yards, 12 touchdowns, eight interceptions, 66.1 completion percentage, 133.9 QBR
Smith played in every regular season game but also split snaps between two backup quarterbacks. Freshman Behren Morton played with Smith at the beginning of the year and threw for 1,117 yards, seven touchdowns, and six interceptions. The third wheel was senior Tyler Shough, who recorded 1,062 passing yards, six touchdowns, and three interceptions.
I'm predicting Smith to start the game for the Red Raiders, but you never know who they might throw in to try and switch things up.
Rushing: RB Sarodorick Thompson
2022 stats: 132 carries, 670 rushing yards, six touchdowns, averaged 5.1 yards per carry
Thompson led Texas Tech in rushing yards this fall with 670, but junior tailback Tahj Brooks recorded more carries (133) and rushing touchdowns (7). Together, the tandem totaled 1,271 rushing yards and 13 rushing touchdowns. 
At the quarterback position, Smith also proved to be a rushing threat out of the pocket. Smith finished with 116 rushing yards and seven rushing touchdowns in 12 games.
The Red Raiders have options in their rushing attack which will certainly factor into their matchup with Ole Miss. It will be interesting to see if the Rebels made any adjustments to their run defense over the break, which was porous at times during the regular season.
Receiving: WR Jerand Bradley 
2022 stats: 43 receptions, 656 receiving yards, five touchdowns, averaged 15.3 yards per reception 
Bradley, a massive 6-5, 215-pound freshman, led the Red Raiders in receiving yards (656) and touchdowns (5), but senior receiver Myles Price finished first in receptions with 48. 
Bradley will be the guy to keep an eye on as he is easily one of if not, the biggest guys in the Texas Tech receiver room.
Overview
The Red Raiders finished their season with an overall balanced offensive attack, amassing 25 passing and rushing touchdowns. Texas Tech averaged 307.0 passing yards per game, 152.5 rushing yards per game, and 33.6 points per game.
While they do not blow you away in any category specifically, the Red Raiders have a solid offense full of athletic playmakers which should provide an interesting bowl matchup for an Ole Miss defense that surrendered 24.17 ppg this fall.

https://www.si.com/college/olemiss/football/ole-miss-rebels-early-signing-day-wrap-immediate-impact-offense,Ole Miss Rebels Early Signing Day Wrap: Who Makes Early Impact on Offense?,"The Ole Miss Rebels have signed a solid 2023 class that is full of playmakers. Who can be expected to make an immediate impact on the offensive side of the ball?
OXFORD, Miss. -- The first day of the early signing period has come and gone, and the Ole Miss Rebels ended day one with a solid group of recruits consisting of seven four-stars.
While Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin mentioned in his Wednesday afternoon presser that there is still work to be done, the bulk of the Rebels' 2023 recruits have handed in their papers, and are ready to compete in Vaught-Hemingway Stadium next fall.
We recently reviewed the defensive recruits, and now it is time to look at some notable names on the offensive side of the ball who could make an impact in their freshman season.
1) OL Brycen Sanders
It was a tough choice for the No. 1 spot, but I believe Sanders could have an immediate impact on the Ole Miss offense out of the gate. With stalwart offensive lineman Nick Broeker heading to the 2023 NFL Draft, the Rebels need a replacement for their most reliable lineman in the last few years. 
Enter Sanders, a 6-6, 280-pound recruit who played at four different positions on the offensive line in high school. While Sanders has the athleticism and quickness to hold up in pass protection, the four-star recruit has made a name for himself as a people mover in the run game. Sanders is a power player who will fit right in with an Ole Miss offense that loves to run the ball.
Sanders also has a winning pedigree as he helped the Baylor School secure a state title in early December.
2) WR Ayden Williams
With the Rebels being thin at the receiver position currently, Williams nearly made the No. 1 spot on this list. The four-star is rated as the No. 2 recruit in the state of Mississippi and the No. 15 receiver in his class. While I believe Kiffin will continue to beef up his receiving room via the transfer portal, Williams has a chance to step in a steal the show as a true freshman. 
Equipped with a 6-3, 195-pound frame and speed that kills, Williams could become Jaxson Dart's new favorite target next fall.
3) RB Kedrick Reescano
With Zach Evans’ future at Ole Miss up in the air, Kiffin needed to lock down a partner in crime for the SEC's leading rusher in 2022, Quinshon Judkins. Kiffin did just that when he convinced former Michigan State running back commit Kedrick Reescano to flip to Ole Miss last Saturday. The four-star is rated as the No. 8 running back in the nation and the No. 33 recruit in the state of Texas. 
The Rebels hit a home run with their first running back signing of the 2023 recruitment cycle, as Reescano rushed for an impressive 1,849 yards and amassed 36 touchdowns as a high school senior. 
4). TE Jayvontay Conner
One of the most intriguing players from Ole Miss' 2023 recruiting cycle, Jayvontay Conner could be poised to contribute to the Rebel offense right away. The three-star recruit is rated as the No. 32 tight end in the country and the No. 22 player in the state of North Carolina. 
Conner is a modern tight end who brings versatility to an offense that uses the position heavily. With a 6-4, 240-pound frame, Conner is built like a big receiver but is not afraid to get his hands dirty in the run game. A natural receiver, if Conner improves in the run-blocking department, he could find a place for himself in Kiffin's offense.

OXFORD, Miss. -- The Ole Miss Rebels weren't done on Wednesday at the time of Lane Kiffin's press conference.
A little after 6:30 p.m. CT on Wednesday, Cayden Lee, a wide receiver out Kennesaw Mountain (Ga.) High School signed his letter of intent to play in Oxford next season. This season, Lee hauled in over 1,000 receiving yards and 13 touchdowns for his hometown Mustangs, and he will now be bringing that talent to Lane Kiffin's offense in Oxford.
Kiffin himself hinted at the fact that this recruiting cycle was not finished on Wednesday.
""There's still work being done,"" Kiffin told reporters. ""This is a strange signing time...it's not our full class, with guys potentially still out there to sign later today or on normal signing day. Plus with so many transfers, some already coming here and a lot we're still working on... we can't even talk about the ones coming here. It's a little bit strange...It's like talking about your draft class before the third day of the draft.""

https://www.si.com/college/olemiss/football/ole-miss-rebels-coach-lane-kiffin-early-signing-day-presser,'There's Still Work Being Done': Lane Kiffin on Current State of Ole Miss' Recruiting Class,"Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin updated the media in the middle of early signing day.
OXFORD, Miss. -- The first day of the early signing period has come and gone, and the Ole Miss Rebels had a good day overall. 
While they lost a pair of four-star commits in edge Neo Avery and quarterback Marcel Reed, the Rebels were able to reel in a solid class that emphasizes quality over quantity, but they are not done yet. 
Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin addressed the media on Wednesday in the middle of this strange and chaotic recruiting cycle making a point in his opening statement that the job is not yet finished. 
""There's still work being done,"" Kiffin told reporters. ""This is a strange signing time...it's not our full class, with guys potentially still out there to sign later today or on normal signing day. Plus with so many transfers, some already coming here and a lot we're still working on... we can't even talk about the ones coming here. It's a little bit strange...It's like talking about your draft class before the third day of the draft.""
While the job is not done, Kiffin mentioned that he is satisfied with where the class currently stands, especially with the in-state recruits.
""Excited about the guys who [have already signed],"" Kiffin said. ""I think there's a lot of really good players in that group. Our coaches did a good job and our entire program is working really hard to put this together...Keeping a couple of really high-impact recruits from the state of Mississippi home.""
Three of Ole Miss' top four signees are home-grown recruits who decided to stay in the sip. One of them happens to be the No. 1 recruit in the state, linebacker/running back Suntarine Perkins.
It was mentioned earlier, but losing out on Reed puts the Rebels in a bit of a pickle at the quarterback position. Backup quarterback Luke Altmyer has entered the NCAA Transfer Portal and with Kinkead Dent's future up in the air, Jaxson Dart could be the only quarterback on scholarship soon enough. Kiffin addressed the depth concerns at the quarterback position.
""Things aren't always what they appear to be, I wouldn't say we lost a quarterback,"" Kiffin said. ""It is what it is though...We do have some quarterback depth issues to work on. I think that, in general, there are depth issues around the country because you've got all these kids going into the portal...We have a lot of work to do at a number of positions but especially at quarterback.""

OXFORD, Miss. -- The early signing period is upon us.
The majority of prominent high school talent will sign during this window around Christmas, and the Ole Miss Rebels are expecting a wave of signatures over the next few hours. Stick with this tracker from The Grove Report throughout the day as it will be updated in real time as pens hit paper for the program in Oxford.
Lane Kiffin was up and at them before 3:30 am CST Wednesday, natiurally wishing everybody well on what should be a busy signing day. 
It looks like Ole Miss will continue to use a throwback PlayStation 2 theme for its 2023 signees, complete with a 'Sip Street 23' label for the entire group in the light of popular video game NFL Street.

Cayden Lee, a wide receiver out of Kennesaw Mountain (Ga.) High School chose the Rebels on Wednesday night, adding another late piece to the Rebels' signing class in the early signing period.

At least one more Ole Miss target will come off the board tonight in Cayden Lee, who took a late official visit to Oxford. UCF or South Carolina could be viewed as competition.

Neeo Avery officially flipped to Maryland on Wednesday afternoon, as was reported to be possible by The Grove Report yesterday.

Marshall hauled in 11 passes in the 2022 season. He is also a former SI99 player.

Suntarine Perkins and Ayden Williams have both made it official--they will be donning red and blue.
7:30 AM UPDATE
Braxton Myers and Ethan Fields also joined the fold this morning. Daniel Demery also signed shortly after.

Who can be expected to make an impact in their first season in Oxford?
OXFORD, Miss. -- The first day of the early signing period is behind us, and the Ole Miss Rebels have brought in multiple new faces in their 2023 class.
While things may not be finished yet, the majority of the Rebels' additions in this class have officially signed their name to walk through The Grove next season. The question now stands, who could make an early impact for Ole Miss in 2023?
Here is a look at some of the notable defensive names who have joined the ranks in Oxford. 
1) LB Suntarine Perkins
Perkins is a state champion from Raleigh (Miss.) High School where he was a standout on both sides of the ball. In his team's state title game this season, he rushed for over 300 yards as a running back, but he projects as a linebacker at the next level.
Perkins was one of the most sought-after recruits in the country for a reason, drawing attention from the likes of the Alabama Crimson Tide, and he could be poised to have an immediate impact at Ole Miss in his freshman season.
2) LB Jeremiah Jean-Baptiste
Jean-Baptiste, a 6-foot-2, 230-pound linebacker hailing from UCF, announced his commitment to the Ole Miss Rebels earlier this month. It came on the heels of an official visit to Oxford. 
He has appeared in 35 UCF games in his collegiate career, meaning he has a single year of eligibility remaining for the 2023 season. The southern Florida native capped his Knights career with 152 tackles, including 14 for loss, two sacks and an interception before making the transfer to the SEC.
3) DB Ahmad ""AJ"" Brown
You can't have the nickname ""AJ Brown"" and not be expected to be a trendsetter at Ole Miss, right?
Although this new Rebel signee will probably start his career in the secondary, he has some experience at wide receiver as well. This versatile and athletic peice added to the Ole Miss defense has to be exciting for Lane Kiffin and his staff as they pull closer to the offseason.
4) DL Joshua Harris
Harris is another portal player who comes to Oxford by way of the NC State Wolfpack. He didn't see a ton of action in the 2022 season, only bringing in 11 total tackles, but the tools are obviously there for him to be successful in the SEC if he remains healthy. 
Lane Kiffin is the ""Portal King,"" after all, and him taking Harris on means he likes the potential there.
