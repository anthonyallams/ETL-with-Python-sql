https://www.si.com/nfl/dolphins/news/miami-dolphins-head-coach-mike-mcdaniel-december-23-takeaways,Mike McDaniel December 23 Takeaways,"Checking out the key points of Miami Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel's Friday media session ahead of their Week 16 matchup against Green Bay
Head coach Mike McDaniel addressed the media before the Miami Dolphins' Friday practice at the Baptist Health Training Complex.
Here were the highlights from McDaniel's press conference:
-- First question deals with guard Liam Eichenberg and whether he'll be activated for the Green Bay game, and McDaniel says the coaching staff are still talking about it.
-- River Cracraft and Eric Fisher both are dealing with a calf injury, but McDaniel says neither injury is particularly serious even if it could affect their availability for the Green Bay game.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Jaylen Waddle has taken a big step forward in his second season, and McDaniel mentions the work of WR coach Wes Welker staying after him and Tyreek Hill raising the bar for him. McDaniel calls Waddle a ""super athlete"" and a throwback.
-- The Green Bay defense is ranked 29th in the league in yards allowed per game, but McDaniel says the stats might be misleading. Also points out that the Packers are very good in pass defense (they're second in the NFL in that category). ""I expect them to be the best version of themselves.""
-- Packers coach Matt LaFleur and McDaniel coached together in previous NFL stops and McDaniel says one thing he admires about him is his ability to ""stay true to himself.""
-- Hunter Long is a ""cool place"" in his young NFL career where, McDaniel says, he can see where he can fit in this offense and also recognize there's another level to his game he can attack.
-- Raheem Mostert has had a very good season coming back from his season-ending 2021 knee injury, and McDaniel called him ""unique."" Points out that Mostert is among very few athletes who maintain their speed through their late 20s or early 30s. Mentions former NFL wide receiver Joey Galloway as a guy who was like that.

https://www.si.com/nfl/dolphins/news/miami-dolphins-lb-bradley-chubb-looking-to-make-bigger-impact,Assessing Chubb's Dolphins Start,"Bradley Chubb has been solid in his first six games with the Miami Dolphins, but they acquired him to be more than that
It’s been six games since the Miami Dolphins made a splash at the trade deadline by acquiring pass rusher Bradley Chubb from the Denver Broncos, and he’s ready to take the defense and his own play to a higher level. 
Chubb, for whom the Dolphins traded a 2023 first-round pick, a fourth-round pick in 2024 and running back Chase Edmonds, said he believes his performance has been a “B” so far. 
“I’ve had good plays here and there, but I want to be more dominant,” Chubb said Thursday. “I want to be taking over games more, and that’s kind of the reason they brought me here is to do that — to help this defense take it to the next level. I feel like, yeah, we took it up a notch, but there’s a whole ‘nother level we could take it to, and I want to be the catalyst for that.”
Chubb reaching a dominant level of play is something Miami’s defense is going to need if they have higher aspirations than just a playoff appearance. In the long term, Miami paid a premium price in trade assets, and with his new contract extension, so “dominant” should be the expectation for his play. 
In his six games with Miami, Chubb hasn’t been dominant. He’s recorded 2.5 sacks and one forced fumble so far. In seven games with the Broncos, Chubb had 5.5 sacks and two forced fumbles. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In fairness to Chubb, he’s still learning to play in Miami’s scheme, which is much different than the one he played in with the Broncos. 
“It’s been good, man,” Chubb said about his transition. “I’m just learning each and every day still about my teammates, about my coaches, about the scheme, and just the different little nuances in it where I could get better just not throughout the play but just (say), ‘OK, they’re doing this on that side. OK, I can do this on this side.’ Just learning stuff like that and how I can take my game to the next level. But it’s been great. I’ve been enjoying it and ready to keep it moving.”
Chubb’s calling card always has been his ability to get to the passer. While sacks are an eye-catching stat, they don’t always paint the full picture of a pass rusher's effectiveness. 
Chubb still ranks sixth among edge players in ESPN’s pass rush win rate, and he’s generated 47 total pressures this season, which ranks 17th in the entire league, according to PFF. 
However, Miami’s defense blitzes a lot of second-level defenders to generate sacks and tends to emphasize stopping the run over pressuring the passer. Thus, Chubb’s raw pass rush numbers (sacks) were probably going to dip regardless of performance. 
Chubb mentioned one of the biggest keys for an edge defender in Miami’s scheme is setting the edge against the run. 
“The main key is just setting the edge of the defense,” Chubb said. “I feel like with the guys we’ve got around, it’s cool for me to make sure I set the edge in the run, and then if it is a play-action pass, OK — I can convert late because all the guys are around. It’s not like it’s, ‘Oh, if I don’t get off and do this, then it’s a 60-yard touchdown.’ So having talent around and understanding within the defense, understanding where your help is at and all that, it makes it a lot easier, for sure.”
It seems like Chubb is taking to his role as a run defender well enough. Miami’s run defense improves from -0.11 EPA per play to 0.07 EPA per play when Chubb is on the field, according to Sports Info Solutions. 
All of the metrics we’ve highlighted point to Chubb being an above-average, quality player for the Dolphins. However, Miami’s investment in Chubb — contract and draft capital — means the expectations should be for a dominant player. 
Although sacks and other raw stats can be misleading, they do often correlate with the league's best players. Pressures are great but sacks are better. 
Simply put, Chubb is right when he says there is another level he can reach despite his overall solid play since joining the Dolphins. Miami’s defensive coordinator, Josh Boyer, agrees. 
“I think Chubb has done some good things for us from a rush standpoint,” Boyer said. “I think he’s done some good things for us in the run game. I think he’s given us the ability to utilize all three other guys, and we’ve been able to keep them a little bit fresh as we’re going. And again, it’s one of those things that each week, he’s just adding to the things that he’s already brought to us.”
The jury is still out on whether Chubb will live up to his trade price and contract, but the early returns are solid enough to stay optimistic. ","Sports Illustrated Miami Dolphins News, Analysis and More","Bradley chubb, News, Miami dolphins trades, Miami dolphins 2022 season, Miami dolphins",Dante collinelli,"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 16:09:28 GMT","Bradley Chubb has been solid in his first six games with the Miami Dolphins, but they acquired him to be more than that",https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NTM2MDMzNjg4MjMzNTgy/usatsi_19644915_168390362_lowres.jpg
https://www.si.com/nfl/dolphins/news/dolphins-playoff-picture-clearer-and-better-after-jets-loss,Dolphins Playoff Picture Clearer (And Better) After Jets Loss,"The Miami Dolphins can clinch the playoffs in Week 17 without any outside help
The New York Jets' performance on Thursday night football could accurately be described as ugly, but it most definitely was beautiful when it comes to the Miami Dolphins' playoff outlook.
The Dolphins didn't need any outside help at the start of Week 16 to earn their first playoff berth since 2016, but their path got significantly smoother and easier following the Jets' 19-3 home loss against the Jacksonville Jaguars that featured 2021 second overall pick Zach Wilson benched in the third quarter in favor of former CFL QB Chris Streveler, the same Chris Streveler who the Dolphins signed in February only to release him before the start of OTAs after they drafted Skylar Thompson in the seventh round.
In any event, the Jets loss improved the Dolphins' playoff chances from 72 to 78 percent, according to fivethirtyeight.com.
The Dolphins now can clinch a playoff spot in Week 17 simply by winning their next two games — against the Green Bay Packers at Hard Rock Stadium on Sunday, and at New England on New York's Day.
The idea of winning the AFC East title pretty much disappeared last Saturday night because the Dolphins would have to go 3-0 in their final three games and have the Bills go 0-3 against Chicago, Cincinnati and New England.
But a 3-0 finish by the Dolphins could open the door to the possibility of getting the No. 5 seed and facing the AFC South champion (Tennessee or Jacksonville) in the first round.
Baltimore currently holds that No. 5 spot with a 9-5 record and closes the season at home against Atlanta and Pittsburgh, and on the road against AFC North leader Cincinnati.
If the Dolphins and Ravens both finish at 11-6, the Dolphins would get the higher seed because of their Week 2 victory at Baltimore. But the caveat there is that the Chargers also could finish at 11-6 — they close at Indianapolis, at home against the Rams and at Denver — and they would get the tiebreaker advantage.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
After the Jets loss against Jacksonville, the Dolphins will make the playoffs in any scenarios where they finish 2-1 EXCEPT if the loss is against New England in Week 16 and the Patriots also defeat Cincinnati on Saturday and the Buffalo Bills at Highmark Stadium in Week 17.
If they finish 1-2, the Dolphins still could make the playoffs, though they would need outside help. Their percentage with one victory in the final three games, according to fivethirtyeight.com, is 75 percent if that one win came against the Jets, 64 percent if that one win came against New England, and 33 percent if the Dolphins defeat Green Bay but lose their final two against the AFC East opponent.
Only because we want to be thorough, we also have to include the worst-case scenario, and in the event of an 0-3 finish, the Dolphins would have no chance of making the playoffs.

https://www.si.com/nfl/dolphins/news/miami-dolphins-opponent-breakdown-green-bay-packers,Dolphins Opponent Breakdown: Green Bay Packers,"The Miami Dolphins will look to move to 9-6 on the season when they face the Green Bay Packers at Hard Rock Stadium on Christmas Day
The Miami Dolphins will look to end their three-game losing streak and move to 9-6 on the season when they face the Green Bay Packers at Hard Rock Stadium on Sunday afternoon.
This will be the fourth of four games against NFC North Division for the Dolphins, who lost at home against the Minnesota Vikings and won on the road against the Detroit Lions and Chicago Bears. The Packers will go into the game with a 6-8 record and in 10th place in the NFC standings following their 24-12 victory against the Los Angeles Rams on Monday night.
To get some answers on five major questions related to the Packers, we turned to Bill Huber, Publisher of Fan Nation sister site Packer Central.
BH: Probably a little of both. I do think the Packers have made some strides. From Game 10 through Game 13, the Packers were sixth in scoring during that four-game stretch of Dallas, Tennessee, Philadelphia and Chicago. There’s three playoff teams in that bunch. In the cold on Monday night, they only scored 24 but they took a knee at the 1 so could have gotten to 30 again. They’ve run the ball well for most of the season. With the emergence of rookie receiver Christian Watson and with four-fifths of the offensive line having started the last six games together, the growth is real. That being said, the Bears are in 16th place in the NFC and the Rams are in 15th place. Green Bay took care of business and won those games but hardly looked like a high-quality team.
BH: Rodgers is an above-average starter. It’s been a challenge this year. They traded Davante Adams and replaced him with way-past-his-prime veteran Sammy Watkins and three draft picks. Between the upheaval at receiver, the uncertainty on the offensive line with studs David Bakhtiari and Elgton Jenkins coming off knee injuries, and a broken thumb sustained in Week 5, it’s been a struggle compared to his four MVP seasons. But the rookies have gained some critical seasoning, the line has found some stability and the thumb no longer is an issue. Rodgers was really sharp against the Rams on Monday night. I would think the NFC’s playoff contenders will be cheering for the Dolphins on Sunday. With a potentially powerful offense and the momentum from what would be a five-game winning streak, I don’t think any team would want to face the Packers in the postseason.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
BH: Watson. Remember that No. 6 ranking in scoring? That’s largely on the strength of the rookie’s incredible four-game stretch of eight touchdowns. No rookie receiver in NFL history scored so many touchdowns over such a short period of time. A star at North Dakota State, the Packers traded up to get him with the 34th overall pick of the draft. He’s just so big and fast. A few weeks ago at Chicago, he scored the winning touchdown on a jet sweep. The player who made the key block, Watkins, started celebrating when Watson was at the 40. The Bears defender in pursuit beat 4.40 in the 40 at his pro day. By comparison to Watson, it looked like he was running through wet concrete. The Rams put Jalen Ramsey on him for a decent chunk of Monday’s game. Watson caught only four passes but drew two penalties (and there should have been a third for holding/interference/tripping). He is going to be a star.
BH: The Packers have one of the best cornerbacks in the NFL in Jaire Alexander. An All-Pro in 2020, he missed most of 2021 with a shoulder injury but was named to the 2022 Pro Bowl team this week. I don’t know that he’s going to shadow Tyreek Hill but those will be some must-see snaps. He’s got the speed, talent and mentality to go up against anyone. The other corner is Rasul Douglas, who is a really good player but speed is not his game. Keisean Nixon has taken over in the slot; he’s got plenty of speed but doesn’t have an abundance of experience. A great pass rush would help but the Packers don’t have that; their top rusher, Rashan Gary, suffered a torn ACL at midseason. I would assume defensive coordinator Joe Barry will have his corners play a mile off Hill and Jaylen Waddle and hope the Dolphins shoot themselves in the foot enough so it’s field goals instead of touchdowns.
 BH: The Packers have to run the ball, which they’re well equipped to do with Aaron Jones and A.J. Dillon. Run the ball, control the clock, stay out of third-and-long (and away from the Dolphins’ pass rush) and strike on play-action. Of course, that’s everyone’s formula, right? That’s right out of the “Football for Total Idiots” playbook. Listen, I’m not comparing Watson and fellow rookie Romeo Doubs to Hill and Waddle. Because of injuries, Watson and Doubs had played only 52 snaps together the first 13 games. With Doubs back from an ankle injury against the Rams, they shared the field on 13 snaps. Rodgers was 7-of-7 passing on those plays and the Packers picked up eight first downs. The field-stretching threat of Watson opened up some easy completions to Doubs. If the Packers can run the ball and get that type of efficiency in the passing game, they’ve got a real chance.

https://www.si.com/nfl/dolphins/news/miami-dolphins-playoff-fate-could-be-determined-after-week-17,Two Extreme Dolphins Playoff Scenarios,"The Miami Dolphins have all sorts of playoff scenarios with three weeks left in the 2022 regular season
The Miami Dolphins still hold a playoff position despite their current three-game losing streak, and their playoff outlook can go from one extreme to another depending on what happens in their next two games.
The Dolphins will next face the Green Bay Packers on Christmas Day, followed by a game against the New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium on New Year's Day, and it's possible they will have clinched a playoff berth by the end of Week 17 — before their Week 18 game against the New York Jets.
But here's the crazy part: It's also conceivable the Dolphins could be eliminated from playoff contention in Week 17.
This is very simple, and it starts with the Dolphins defeating both the Packers and Patriots to move to 10-6 on the season, assuring them of no worse than a 10-7 finish.
The only other thing that would need to happen would be for the New York Jets to lose one of their next two games, at home against Jacksonville on Thursday night or at Seattle in Week 17.
Under this scenario, the Dolphins would be assured of being among the wild cards with at least 10 wins because the Patriots and Jets would then have at least eight losses.
So is crazy to think about, particularly after the Dolphins were 8-3 not so long ago, but in the interest of being thorough, here's what the worst-case scenario would look like.
-- It obviously starts with the Dolphins losing against Green Bay and New England, which would put them at 8-8.
-- The Jets defeat both Jacksonville and Seattle.
-- New England wins at home against the Cincinnati Bengals on Saturday.
-- The Los Angeles Chargers win at Indianapolis on Monday night.
-- The Baltimore Ravens win either one of their next two games, both at home, against the Atlanta Falcons and Pittsburgh Steelers.
Under that scenario, the Dolphins still could finish 9-8 with a victory against the Jets in Week 17 and could be involved in a tie for the final playoff spot or two with potentially the Jets, Patriots and Chargers.
Two of those four teams would join the AFC playoff field along with Buffalo, Kansas City and Cincinnati, who already at least 10 wins; Baltimore, which would get to 10 wins with one more victory; and the AFC South champion (Tennessee or Jacksonville).
And those two teams that would make the playoffs in the event of a four-way tie at 9-8 would be New England and the Chargers.
Even removing either the Patriots or Chargers from the equation with another win for either to finish 10-7 doesn't help the Dolphins because they would lose the tiebreaker to whichever of the two was at 9-8.
In multiple-team tiebreaker scenarios, settling division tiebreakers always is the first step and the Patriots would get the nod by virtue of head-to-head record thanks to their sweep of the Jets (Dolphins-Patriots and Dolphins-Jets would be splits).
The Dolphins would finish higher than the Jets, but lose the tiebreaker against the Chargers for the final AFC playoff spot because of L.A.'s head-to-head victory at SoFi Stadium in Week 14.
Based on all the permutations, it's much more likely the Dolphins would clinch in Week 17 than be eliminated, but maybe the biggest likelihood of all is that nothing will be decided until the final Sunday of the regular season.","Sports Illustrated Miami Dolphins News, Analysis and More","News, Nfl playoff scenarios, Miami dolphins, Miami dolphins vs. green bay packers, Nfl playoffs",Alain poupart,"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 22:03:56 GMT",The Miami Dolphins have all sorts of playoff scenarios with three weeks left in the 2022 regular season,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NTIzMTM2MTY5ODc4OTE1/usatsi_19644039_168390362_lowres.jpg
https://www.si.com/nfl/dolphins/news/miami-dolphins-passing-thoughts-on-waddles-big-jump-drops-tyreeks-mea-culpa,"Dolphins Passing Thoughts: Waddle's Big Jump, Drops, Tyreek's Mea Culpa","Jaylen Waddle has gone from having a disappointing receiving average to having the best in the NFL
Jaylen Waddle is on pace to accomplish something only one other Miami Dolphins player has ever done, and it's among the many examples of the explosion of the passing game in 2022.
Waddle currently leads the NFL in yards per reception (among qualifying players) at 18.02, with 1,117 yards on 62 catches. Gabriel Davis of the Buffalo Bills is second at 17.90.
The only Dolphins player to lead the NFL in that category was Chris Chambers, who averaged 18.4 in 2001 when he was a rookie second-round pick out of Wisconsin.
For anyone wondering, Waddle probably has no shot at the franchise record, which is the ridiculous 25.1 posted in 1971 by Hall of Famer Paul Warfield.
Waddle's average is impressive enough in itself, but it's even more remarkable when you consider that he was under 10 yards per catch in 2021 when he set the NFL rookie record for catches with 104. His average of 9.8 yards last year ranked him 98th in the NFL among qualifying players.
What's changed?
That's a pretty easy answer and it's certainly not Waddle's speed, which has been pretty eye-opening since he arrived. in South Florida as the sixth overall pick in the 2021 NFL draft.
The improvement in Waddle's receiving average clearly is the result of a combination — in whatever order you prefer — of Mike McDaniel's scheme, Tua Tagovailoa's big jump at quarterback, and having Tyreek Hill (and his equally stupid speed) on the other side.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
While Tyreek Hill leads the Dolphins (and is second in the NFL) with 1,117 receiving yards, he trails Waddle in average per reception. He's at 14.03, which ranks a respectable 17th in the league.
As for where that would rank in his career, it would be well above the 11.2 he averaged last year in Kansas City when he reached 100 catches for the first time but below each of the four seasons before that.
But the combination of catches and average has helped Hill already surpass his career high with 1,529 yards, which also has set a new Dolphins record — Mark Clayton held the mark with 1,389 in 1984.
Hill and Waddle are tied for the team lead with seven touchdowns, but Hill was bemoaning the one that got away in the second quarter of the 32-29 loss at Buffalo on Saturday.
Hill had nine catches for 89 yards and a touchdown against Buffalo, but made clear via Twitter the next day he wasn't happy with his performance.
If it seems the Dolphins have dropped a lot of passes this season, well, it's because they have.
While what constitutes a ""drop"" is subjected, the Dolphins are tied for the NFL ""lead"" in this dubious category with the Buffalo Bills with 34, according to Pro Football Reference.
Hill leads the Dolphins in this category, according to Pro Football Reference, with eight, followed by Waddle with seven and fullback Alec Ingold with four. Trent Sherfield has three, with Mike Gesicki, Raheem Mostert and Tanner Conner with two apiece.
Conner, the rookie free agent, dropped passes in consecutive weeks against the Jets and Minnesota in October and hasn't been targeted since.
Wide receivers coach Wes Welker was asked during his media session Thursday whether drops were an issue for his position group and he quickly said no.
He also made an interesting comment when he said that the end zone pass that Hill failed to corral in the second quarter would have been ""a hell of a catch.""
Welker later was asked whether he would consider it a drop, and he hesitated before saying yes — the answer you absolutely would expect from a former NFL wide receiver coach who now coaches that position.
But the mere fact that he hesitated proves there's no merit to the idea that it wasn't necessarily and out-an-out drop. After all, if it's a ""hell of a catch"" is the ball is caught, then how can it be a drop if it isn't caught?
It's why we referred to it all along as a makable catch that Hill didn't make as opposed to a drop.

https://www.si.com/nfl/dolphins/news/miami-dolphins-pro-bowl-reflections,Pro Bowl Dolphins Fallout and Reflections,"The Miami Dolphins had three players selected to the original AFC roster along with four first-team alernates
It's the morning after the initial Pro Bowl rosters were announced, and as is always the case there was some strong reaction to some of the selections and omissions.
For the Miami Dolphins, the most debatable calls involved QB Tua Tagovailoa, WR Jaylen Waddle, DT Christian Wilkins and CB Xavien Howard — three players who weren't selected and one who was.
Let's break it down:
Determining a Pro Bowl snub obviously is highly suggestive, but there can be no denying that Tua, Waddle and Wilkins all had strong cases to get selected.
Obviously it's the omission of Tua that created the biggest stir among Dolphins and even the national media, which is understandable given his stats and the fact he led all NFL players at any position in fan voting.
So it was the other two-third of the votes (one-third from the players, one-third from the coaches) that got Tua left behind Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow and Josh Allen as the AFC quarterbacks.
Before we move along, let's understand that it is almost certain that when the Pro Bowl Games take place Feb. 5 Tua either will be participating in them as an alternate or he'll be preparing for the Dolphins to play in the Super Bowl if they achieve that goal.
But Tua certainly had a case to make the initial AFC roster, and there would seem to be two clear reasons he didn't.
The first is the standing and reputation of the three QBs chosen ahead of him, and the fact that Mahomes, Allen and Burrow are second, third and fourth as NFL MVP favorites behind Jalen Hurts based on odds from BetOline, whereas Tua Tagovailoa now is off the board.
And then there's this under-the-radar factor that easily could have played a role in voting from players and coaches. Tua and the Dolphins were on the last Sunday night game before the votes were cast and the offense struggling on national television would have been the last impression on the rest of the NFL.
In the Dolphins' other two-prime appearances this season, where Tua could have the attention of the entire NFL, he was injured in the Thursday night game at Cincinnati and he had a sub-par outing in the Sunday night game against Pittsburgh.
Waddle also had a strong case for his first Pro Bowl, starting with an NFL-best 18.02 receiving average and his 1,117 receiving yards, which ranks fourth among AFC wide receivers.
The three ahead of him are Pro Bowl selections Tyreek Hill, Stefon Diggs and Davante Adams. But instead of Waddle, the fourth spot went to Ja'Marr Chase of the Cincinnati Bengals.
Chase missed four games in the middle of the season, but still has more catches than Waddle (71-62), but the big difference here again might have been the Dolphins' poor offensive showing in California because those were the last two games before the Pro Bowl votes and recency bias certainly can be a thing.
Against the 49ers and Chargers, Waddle had a combined three catches for 40 yards, which might have made it easier for players and coaches to forget about his earlier standout performances against Baltimore, Buffalo and Detroit, among others.
Like Tua and Waddle, Wilkins was a first alternate, and here it might be the Dolphins' defensive scheme that hurt him in the Pro Bowl voting.
Even though he does a lot of his work inside, Wilkins is listed as a defensive end with the Dolphins utilizing a 3-4 alignment most often. The three AFC selections at defensive end were Myles Garrett, Maxx Crosby and Trey Hendrickson, who all play in 4-3 schemes, where it's easier for a defensive end to rack up sack totals.
And, like it or not, that's often what voters will use to make their selections.
And, even then, the Hendrickson pick was weird considering he had six sacks on the season among his 29 tackles, as well as two forced fumbles.
Compare that to Wilkins, who may have only 2.5 sacks but 81 tackles (the highest total for an NFL defensive lineman) and the same two forced fumbles as Hendrickson, and it's easy to make the argument that Wilkins might have been the biggest Dolphins snub of all.
Fullback Alec Ingold is the only Dolphins player selected as a first alternate along with Tua, Waddle and Wilkins, but it seemed almost a given that Baltimore's Patrick Ricard would get the nod considering he was the AFC Pro Bowl fullback the previous three seasons and he won the fan vote at the position.

Of the three Dolphins players who did get selected to the initial Pro Bowl team, Tyreek Hill was the biggest slam dunk, followed by tackle Terron Armstead, who has played very well through injuries and also had the reputation to get votes from those who maybe didn't get to see everybody play.
Reputation is what came into play for Xavien Howard, who has been a terrific cornerback for the Dolphins over the years but flat-out has not had what anybody objectively would call a Pro Bowl season.
According to Pro Football Reference, Howard is allowing a 58.6 completion percentage and a 102.4 opponent passer rating when targeted, and both figures rank as his second-worst since he first became a Pro Bowl player in 2018 ahead only of the 2019 season when he played five games before landing on injured reserve.
Rookie Sauce Gardner, Pat Surtain II and Marlon Humphrey were the other AFC cornerbacks selected to the initial Pro Bowl roster, and there truthfully were a lot of other players at the position more deserving this season than Howard, among them Pittsburgh's Cameron Sutton, New England's Jonathan Jones, Indy's Stephon Gilmore and Buffalo's Dane Jackson.
Outside of Gilmore, though, none of them have Howard's name or reputation.
-- Tua not getting selected will have an impact if the Dolphins pick up his fifth-year option for 2024, which they undoubtedly will do unless they sign him to a long-term contract extension instead. Tua's fifth-year option number, per overthecap.com, will be $22.7 million instead of the $28 million it would have been had Tua been selected to one Pro Bowl in his first three seasons. To be sure, the extra $5.3 million wouldn't have made a difference in the Dolphins' decision here.
-- Not that there were any doubts remaining, but the Pro Bowl selections of Hill and Armstead put the final stamp of validation on the Dolphins' two major acquisitions of the offseason.
-- The Dolphins' three Pro Bowl selections tied for fifth among AFC teams with Cincinnati, Cleveland, Las Vegas and Tennessee. The teams with more were Kansas City (7), Baltimore (6), Buffalo (4) and the New York Jets (4).

https://www.si.com/nfl/dolphins/news/miami-dolphins-get-three-pro-bowl-players-but-not-qb-tua-tagovailoa,"Dolphins Get Three Pro Bowl Players, But Not Tua","Tyreek Hill, Terron Armstead and Xavien Howard all were selected to the initial 2023 AFC roster, though additional Miami Dolphins players eventually could be added as alternates
For the first time since 2017, the Miami Dolphins had more than one player selected to the Pro Bowl — even though quarterback Tua Tagovailoa wasn't one of them.
Wide receiver Tyreek Hill, tackle Terron Armstead and cornerback Xavien Howard were the Dolphins players among the initial selections.
Tagovailoa leads the NFL in passer rating among several significant passing categories and also led all AFC quarterbacks in fan voting, but he was bypassed after the player and coach votes by Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs, Josh Allen of the Buffalo and Joe Burrow of the Cincinnati Bengals.
With those three among the leading candidates for NFL MVP consideration — based at least on odds from BetOnline (www.betonline.ag — this was not totally unexpected, as we predicted earlier.
Tagovailoa was selected as the first alternate and will go to the 2023 Pro Bowl Games if any Mahomes, Allen or Burrow bow out because of injury of if the Chiefs, Bills or Bengals are playing in the Super Bowl.
Hill was the biggest slam dunk of all for the Dolphins this season and he was selected to the Pro Bowl for the seventh time in seven NFL seasons. A case could have been made for fellow Dolphins wide receiver Jaylen Waddle, but the three AFC players selected along with Hill were Davante Adams, Stefon Diggs and Ja'Marr Chase.
Hill and Diggs were the two selected as starters. Waddle was selected as the first alternate.
Armstead made the Pro Bowl for the fourth time in his career, and his selection was a testament to his toughness in being able to play through injuries throughout the season.
His reputation certainly helped Armstead's status in getting the Pro Bowl nod, though his performance also has been top-notch whenever he's been in the lineup.
Armstead was selected as one of the two starters, along with former Dolphins first-round pick Laremy Tunsil.
Howard made the Pro Bowl for the fourth time since joining the Dolphins as a second-round pick in 2016, and this frankly was one of those Pro Bowl selections made on reputation.
Put bluntly, this has not been a particularly impressive season for Howard, who was slowed by groin issues early in the season and simply hasn't been the X that Dolphins fans have come to know. Beyond the fact he's got only one interception on the season, Howard is allowed opposing QBs a ghastly 106.9 passer rating when targeted, according to Pro Football Reference.
Unlike Hill and Armstead, Howard was not selected as a starter. That distinction belonged to Denver Broncos star Pat Surtain II, the son of the former three-time Dolphins cornerback of the same name, and rookie Sauce Gardner of the New York Jets. Marlon Humphrey was the other cornerback selected.
Along with Tagovailoa and Waddle, another player who had a case for making the Pro Bowl was defensive lineman Christian Wilkins. Fullback Alec Ingold led all AFC players at his position in fan voting, but the fullback spot went to Patrick Ricard of the Baltimore Ravens.
Along with the three players selected, the Dolphins had four players selected as a first at their position — they will take part in the 2023 Pro Bowl Games if players bow out because of injuries or because their team is involved in the Super Bowl.
Along with Tua, the Dolphins first alternates were Ingold, Waddle and defensive end Christian Wilkins.
Outside linebacker Bradley Chubb was selected as a second alternate, safety Jevon Holland was a fourth alternate and tight end Mike Gesicki was a fifth alternate.

The Miami Dolphins had a pretty lengthy first injury report of the week ahead of their matchup against the Green Bay Packers, including three players who did not practice because of injuries.
One of them was tackle Terron Armstead, whose absence on Wednesdays should be expected by now given the various injuries with which he's dealt all season.
Also missing from practice were safety Jevon Holland, who sustained a neck injury in the 32-29 loss against the Buffalo Bills on Saturday night, and wide receiver River Cracraft, who's missed the last two games because of a calf injury.
LB Melvin Ingram and RB Raheem Mostert both also did not practice, but in their case it was about vet rest.
The Dolphins also listed seven players as limited in practice Wednesday, with linebacker Jaelan Phillips a new name on the injury report dealing with a toe injury.
Also limited Wednesday were DB Keion Crossen (knee), T Eric Fisher (calf), LB Duke Riley (ribs), S Eric Rowe (hamstring)), TE Durham Smythe (quad) and RB Jeff Wilson Jr. (hip).
Rowe and Wilson both were inactive against Buffalo.
Finally, three players were listed as full participants but on the injury report: QB Teddy Bridgewater (knee), DB Elijah Campbell (concussion) and CB Kader Kohou (thumb).
Campbell didn't play against Buffalo; Bridgewater has been inactive the past four games.

Green Bay conducted a walk-through Wednesday, so the Packers' injury report was based on an estimation.
Two starting offensive linemen, tackle David Bakhtiari (knee/abdomen) and guard/tackle Elgton Jenkins (knee) were listed as not participating.
Bakhtiari has missed the past two games because of his injury.
Three players were listed as limited participants: S Rudy Ford (wrist/knee), RB Aaron Jones (knee) and CB Keisean Nixon (groin).
QB Aaron Rodgers (right thumb/rib) was the biggest name among the three players listed as full participants. The others were LB Krys Barnes (hand) and RB A.J. Dillon (concussion protocol).

https://www.si.com/nfl/dolphins/news/miami-dolphins-te-mike-gesicki-addresses-lack-of-action,Gesicki Addresses Lack of Action,"Tight end Mike Gesicki pretty much has disappeared from the Miami Dolphins offense, but he's not about to complain about his role
Mike Gesicki began the week of practice for the Miami Dolphins matchup against the Green Bay Packers on Christmas Day the same way he's done it all year, preparing himself for the time when his number is called in the passing game.
It just hasn't been called very often in 2022, which has to rank as one of the biggest surprises with the team this season. In fact, Gesicki has been almost invisible on offense the past four games, with only one catch on five targets against the Texans, 49ers, Chargers and Bills combined.
""I convince myself every single day that this is the day, this is new week, this is whatever because that's how my mind works,"" Gesicki said. ""That's how I operate because the second that you don't is the second that it happens. I stay on my routine every single day, continue to catch 160 balls after practice and do my thing every single day and whether it transforms to Sunday or not, that's not up to me until the opportunity comes. But the one thing I will never, ever, ever let is the opportunity to come and me not be prepared.""
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Through 14 games, Gesicki has a mere 25 catches for 274 yards, putting him on pace for 30 catches for 332 yards on the season.
It's a dramatic fall-off from 2021 when he set career highs with 73 catches and 780 yards. His pace would have him finish with his worst numbers since his rookie season of 2018.
If you don't think Gesicki wants more action, all you have to do is see his conversation with mic'ed-up Buffalo Bills tight end Dawson Knox after the game Saturday night when he tells Knox: ""I'm so happy for you. I'm happy you got paid. I'm happy you're ballin'. I'm happy they're f---ing using you.""
Gesicki didn't deny being frustration by the fact the Dolphins are not using him like the Bills are using Knox, who has 43 catches on the season.
""Yeah, I mean, I'm a competitor,"" Gesicki said. ""I've made plays in this league for a long time and I've proven the player I am. I think that there's probably defensive coordinators out there that are going into watching our film and have to put in time to, or at least used to have to put in time to,  how are we going to affect the game plan with 88 out there and things like that. ""So, I mean, in my opinion, yeah, I could help. But like I said, I'm just gonna, go about it in the most professional way I can, make the most opportunities when they do present themselves if they do, and that's really all I can do. Like I said, I don't call them; I just go out and execute when I'm out there, if I'm out there, whatever it is,
""I just come in here and do my job. Like I said, I don't call the plays, I just go and execute them. Try to do the best of my ability. So I mean, it doesn't make me feel any way. I just want to help this team win football games in any way possible whether that's me being a good teammate or me being on the field, whatever it is.""
Gesicki, of course, is playing on the franchise tag of $10.8 million, which the Dolphins applied before they were able to trade for Tyreek Hill, and one can't help but wonder whether they would have made the same decision had they known they would get the most dynamic receiver in the NFL.
As for Gesicki, he was left with no option but to sign the tag once it was applied ... and who knows if he had waited to sign it whether the Dolphins would have rescinded it after acquiring Hill.
That doesn't matter now, but what does matter is that Gesicki's stats aren't going to help his market value next offseason when he's scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent again — though his agent no doubt will urge potential suitors to focus on what he's done in previous years.
""I'm not thinking about my next contract or anything like that,"" Gesicki said. ""A lot of teams around this league, know me as the playmaker that I've been, but that's not really what I'm focused on right now. Because we got a lot of football ahead of us and there's a lot of exciting things for the future the Miami Dolphins right now. So I'm happy to be a part of it. I'm happy to be here. I'm happy to you put a smile on my face, come in here every single day and be the best teammate that I can be, do whatever I can do day in and day out to help the organization. That's really all I can do.""
One thing Gesicki wanted to make sure when he addressed the media Wednesday was that no one felt sorry for him.
""You guys know me, you guys have watched me play it for five years and see what I've done for the organization,"" Gesicki said. ""And I mean, obviously you want to be out there making plays, you want to be out there in general. So there's a lot that goes into it, but it's not about me. This team isn't built around me. This team is built around so many different parts of this organization. So, it's not about me. When I'm out there, I try to make the most of my opportunities. And when I'm not and I gotta answer questions about it and deal with all the other stuff that comes with it, I just got to be professional about it because I know at some point, it could be this year, but if not, it'll be next year and I'm gonna make the most of my opportunities when they come.
""I'm playing football, I'm in the NFL, I'm living my dream. Not that that makes everything else easier, but like I don't need pity or anything like that from anybody. I'm gonna go about my business and I'm gonna  be ready whether it's this year, whether it's next year, whenever it is. I want to be ready and I'm not worried about it.""
