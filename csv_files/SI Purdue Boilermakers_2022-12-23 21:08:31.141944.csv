WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Purdue redshirt senior defensive end Jack Sullivan announced Friday that he is entering the transfer portal as a graduate student after five years with the program. 
Sullivan, who earned a degree in professional flight technology and aviation management in the fall, will not be opting out of the team's matchup against LSU in the Citrus Bowl on Jan. 2 at Camping World Stadium in Orlando. 
""I want to thank Purdue for all the opportunities they have afforded me in my time in West Lafayette,"" Sullivan wrote. ""The last five years have given me both experiences and degrees that I will carry with me through life. 
""My family has been a support system second to none and it was with them that I have made the decision to enter the transfer portal as a graduate student. I look forward to where my next opportunity leads me. Until then, I am excited to finish out the season at the bowl game with my teammates."" 
Sullivan has appeared in all 13 games for the Boilermakers so far in 2022, setting career-highs with 38 total tackles and 5.5 sacks. He leads the team in quarterback takedowns while ranking second in tackles for loss. 
The 6-foot-5, 275-pound Sullivan is a native of Plainfield, Ill., and becomes the third starting defensive lineman to announce their decision to enter the transfer portal, joining defensive tackles Branson Deen and Lawrence Johnson. 
During his time at Purdue, Sullivan played in 37 games and tallied 86 total tackles, 14 tackles for loss, 9.5 sacks and seven pass deflections.

The last Big Ten program to hold the top spot in the national rankings in consecutive seasons was Indiana back in 1974-75 and 1975-76 when the Hoosiers spent a total of 28 weeks as the highest-ranked team.
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — For the first time in program history, Purdue basketball welcomed an opponent to Mackey Arena as the No. 1-ranked team in the country. The Boilermakers have reached the top of the national rankings in consecutive seasons, a feat that hasn't been done by a Big Ten program since 1976. 
For now, coach Matt Painter has this year's team sitting at 12-0 overall and 2-0 in conference play following a 74-53 win over New Orleans on Wednesday night. Purdue has once again been thrust into the spotlight, a position it's still getting accustomed to despite relative consistency that dates back to legendary head coach Gene Keady. 
""We get slighted at times,"" Painter said. ""We don't get covered like other people, and I love it because I don't like the attention myself. I couldn't care less. But from a program standpoint, it's pretty cool.""
Before Painter took over the program in 2005, Keady led Purdue to six Big Ten Championships and 17 NCAA Tournament appearances, with two showings in the Elite Eight across 25 seasons. However, it wasn't until last season under Painter that the Boilermakers would attain being ranked No. 1 for the first time in program history. 
""You look at Coach Keady's years, even before that, we've been very consistent through the years,"" Painter said. ""Winning Big Ten championships, competing for Big Ten championships even when we come a little bit short."" 
During the 2021-22 season, Purdue won its first eight games and ascended to the country's top ranking before losing 70-68 on the road against Rutgers on a half-court shot at the buzzer. The team went on to defeat North Carolina State in overtime 82-72 during the Basketball Hall of Fame invitational before dropping to No. 3. 
The Boilermakers finished the season with a 29-8 overall record and a 14-6 mark in the conference, falling short of a Big Ten title during the regular season. The team was also defeated by Iowa 75-66 in the Big Ten Tournament Championship. 
In the 2022 NCAA Tournament, Purdue defeated Yale and Texas before losing to Saint Peter's 67-64 in the Sweet 16. During the offseason, the Boilermakers lost three starters and two more significant contributors to the professional ranks or the transfer portal. 
However, with its success so far in 2022-23 — headlined by blowout victories over Gonzaga and Duke in the Phil Knight Legacy men's basketball tournament — Purdue is once again ranked as the top team in the nation, etching its name alongside historic teams in the conference's history. 
The last time a Big Ten team was ranked No. 1 in back-to-back seasons was Indiana back in 1974-75 and 1975-76 when it spent a total of 28 weeks as the highest-ranked program in the country. 
Under the tutelage of head coach Bob Knight, the Hoosiers went 32-0 and 18-0 in Big Ten play during the 1975-76 season, plowing their way through the NCAA Tournament and winning the school's third national championship. As of the 2022 tournament, they remain the last team to be undefeated National Champions. 
""That's an amazing stat, and these guys have worked really hard,"" Painter said. ""We've not had any handouts, we've had to work for everything. And I'm just proud of our guys. We lost a lot of talent, and our guys didn't get ranked, no one gave them their just due. But we've earned it, we got to keep it up."" 
The Boilermakers will return to action on Thursday, Dec. 29, for their final nonconference matchup before jumping back into Big Ten competition. The team is scheduled to tip off against Florida A&M at 4 p.m. ET in Mackey Arena, and the game will be broadcast on the Big Ten Network.

https://www.si.com/college/purdue/basketball/what-purdue-coach-matt-painter-said-after-win-against-new-orleans,What Purdue Coach Matt Painter Said After Win Against New Orleans,"No. 1 Purdue basketball defeated New Orleans on Wednesday night at Mackey Arena to move to 12-0 on the season. Here's the complete transcript of coach Matt Painter's postgame press conference, including video.
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — No. 1 Purdue basketball stayed undefeated with a 74-53 win over New Orleans on Wednesday night at Mackey Arena. The Boilermakers improved to 12-0 on the season, including a 2-0 mark in Big Ten play. 
Here's the full transcript of coach Matt Painter's postgame press conference, including the full video attached to this article:
Painter: It's kind of an odd deal because anytime you're dealing with a great player who's big, they normally get in foul trouble. And he hasn't this year. And so you just normally have natural times where your center just gets into foul trouble, then you got to find your way through the game. And then you got to have segments of the game where he's not in. 
Well, that hasn't happened with Zach this year. We've played him less minutes in some games that we've won pretty convincingly. But for the most part, when he's been out there, he's done a great job with that, so we haven't had to do it. This was a great game, great experience. 
I thought New Orleans played really hard, did some things. Once again, we didn't shoot the ball well from 3 and we're gonna have to be able to make some shots there. I thought Trey Kaufman was great. Caleb was under the weather and really battled to play for us and I thought that was a great sign. You know, Mason was able to play a lot of minutes after being out which was really good. 
I thought Braden Smith's effect on the game was huge. You know, if you just look when he's out there, he makes things happen. He makes us go just with his decision-making and his toughness and his ability to you know, mix it up. 
Great game. Obviously, Zach's not feeling well, and hopefully, he gets some rest and gets better and he can go on the 29th.
Painter: Purdue is a special place, it's cool. Very fortunate to be a part of it, and obviously we look after each other when things are kind of sticky like it is for those guys competing for a bowl game. 
It's great to see someone of Drew Brees' stature. He can be a lot of places, right? You know, he put in his time and he's still putting in his time trying to help our community and also trying to help our football program. It's pretty cool. It's pretty cool to be a part of it, and the one thing about our place is that it's not something that's just while you're in college. 
Our program, Coach Keady was great at this, not forgetting about guys and trying to help guys. So you just try to pay it forward, do the best you can to help people in the Purdue family.
Painter: It was great. He gets fouled eight times, you're gonna get into a flow. He's had a couple of games where he plays eight to 10 minutes, and you're just not going to get into a flow that way. Zach's a big piece of that. 
I always talk to those guys about like, you look at it like you did something wrong. When in reality, somebody else is playing and that's hard because then the next guy's gotta match to him because he's gonna guard the biggest guy. So who guards that second-biggest guy? Sometimes that guy is traditional, and sometimes he's smaller, or how they scheme and how they do things and how they move. 
But you see when he gets the ball and we run stuff for him how dangerous he is. It was great to see, and it was great for his confidence.
Painter: Oh, it's huge. Because when you sub, I always say that about throwing the ball inside, let's get to their backups. Let's get to their backups. There's a reason why they're backups. Who has great backup five men? Who does? We do. 
Caleb Furst, Mason Gillis, Trey Kaufman, Zach Edey, it's a pretty good frontline. And we said that at the beginning of the season, but you also got a lot of inexperience there where no one's really started, played 30 minutes and then been a main cog of that.
Zach and Trevion split time, and Mason's probably played more, but he also plays off of people. He played off of Trevion and he plays off of Zach. It's great. It shows you what we're capable of, and also shows you our future.
Painter: No, Caleb would have started with Zach. 
Painter: Yeah, it's huge. That's a great question because Trey Kaufman is a great example here. He deserves to play more than eight minutes, but you only get 200 minutes as a coach, right? And then, when you have somebody like Zack, the numbers that he's put down and how efficient he's been, how well he's rebounded, someone's getting shorted there. 
Caleb Furst is getting shorted, Trey Kaufman is gonna get shorted and Mason's getting shorted. That's just factual. Like, if he's playing 30 minutes, now they're splitting 50 minutes between three people, and then if one of them plays really well, like Caleb played so well the second half of Davidson, I'm a fool to take him out. He got 10 rebounds in a half and in shorter time than that. 
So when you look at it that way, now those guys, they got to keep that under consideration. From their perspective, it's hard. But those guys, when they get their opportunity, and if they're mad and they're frustrated, they won't play well. But if they can get it and they can have high character and understand things, now when they get their opportunity — you hear the guys in the NBA say it all the time — you don't get ready, you stay ready. You just stay ready at all times. 
Your number gets called, you get that opportunity, if you're over there mad and you're frustrated and you think that someone's doing you wrong, you're not going to play well. So for him to get this opportunity, it just kind of shows you where his mindset is. He kept his focus on his work and he played well.
Painter: We haven't been a program that, from an attention standpoint, we've been very consistent. You look at Coach Keady's years, even before that, we've been very consistent through the years. Winning Big Ten championships, competing for Big Ten championships even when we come a little bit short. 
So to be able to see that, you know, we get slighted at times. We don't get covered like other people, and I love it because I don't like the attention myself. I could care less. But like from a program standpoint, you know, it's pretty cool. For me, from a selfish standpoint, the place I like is for recruiting. 
Because now people see, hey, back-to-back years you've been No. 1 in the country for the first time in the Big Ten since 1976 with Indiana's great run that they had. That's an amazing stat, and these guys have worked really hard. 
We've not had any handouts, we've had to work for everything. And I'm just proud of our guys. We lost a lot of talent, and our guys didn't get ranked, no one gave them their just due. But we've earned it. But we got to keep it up because this isn't the season. This is just a third of the season.
Painter: I don't know if because there was  a void. I thought what he did well, he's a good jump shooter. And he hasn't shown his pull-up. He's got a good pull-up. So he got deep there and reverse pivoted and made that little turnaround. He's capable of making that, he's made that in high school. 
You know, he plays off with people so he doesn't get a lot of things run for him. Sometimes you don't get anything run for him. What I liked about it was he played off his shot fake. Most of those drives were him shot faking and them leaving their feet and then him getting in there. 
He punched it a couple times where he penetrated and pitched. Those were good plays, then he made a couple plays himself. He got fouled. So I thought he played really well and did some really good things.
Painter: He's had great footwork, that him. Give his high school coach credit. Those guys, you know, he came to campus that way he's got the little spin cycle there. He kind of does it reverse, Mason said that he didn't travel, but we'll have to wait and see. He's kind of got that reverse spin that's very unorthodox, but it's practical. 
He uses it to score the basketball and it just seems to create space and he goes opposite of the way you think he's going. He's good. He's pretty nimble down there. I just think for him, that's his comfort level. Like he just has to be able to get into a game and get comfortable quick. That's a hard thing to do coming off the bench.
Painter: Just trying to be encouraging, just trying to you know, when they do good things like whatever, I'm always saying that I'm big on trying to reinforce doing the right thing instead of just always yelling when someone does the wrong thing. And trying to talk more when people are making mistakes or whatever and kind of talk them through it. 
As long as you're trying to do what we asked you to do, good things are gonna eventually happen in the long run. But just always trying to reinforce I always like that as a player. I always like it when you didn't achieve what you wanted, but you're trying to do what you're supposed to do, I think there's something positive about that. Because obviously, when you do that you stay connected. 
You know, everybody stays on the same page and you're doing what you're supposed to be doing. And sometimes you're gonna fall short in competition, so I'm that way always. 
Painter: We just put Ethan on him and that was our adjustment, more than anything. And that's what stinks for some of our guys coming off the bench in our backcourt, because if Braden Smith's in the game and he's making that kind of impact, then you have to have Ethan on him, it just leaves one slot, right? And that stinks, but it's part of basketball. 
Be that guy that can guard somebody, you know? So when you have that ability like Braden's impact on the game, you're going to stay with them. Zach Edey's impact on the game, you're gonna stay with him. Well, now when someone gets going like that if you're that guy that can shut people down. You got to have the value to where they can't take you out and then that's hard, but it's reality, right? 
And I thought Ethan did a good job. I thought David did a good job. He kind of got away from him in the second half a little bit, and he got to paint a couple times. But I thought Ethan did a really good job on him. 
I thought Ethan did a good job on Foster Loyer. Same thing, Foster Loyer hits a couple 3s and then we put Ethan on him, and then he was done making 3s.
Painter: He has a high competitive spirit. He has a high intellect and he has an edge to him. And that combination always wins. That always wins. He's a smart basketball player. He's selfless. The quality that he has that most young people don't, some people never get it, is that when things go wrong, he takes it. He takes the brunt of the blame, owns it, and then anytime you can own something, you can fix something. 
And so a lot of young people don't understand that. Like, we live in a messed up society. Everyone's got to be blamed for something, you know what I mean? I don't have to point a finger when something goes wrong. Let's just own it and fix it, and he's great at it. He's fabulous because he doesn't do that himself. And so I think anytime you have the guy with the basketball that's that way, Fletcher has a lot of the same qualities. And you kind of see both of them. 
When that ball's loose, we got some guys going after it. From Mason to Fletcher to him, but anybody. It's contagious. Good stuff's contagious and bad stuff's contagious, but if you know how to handle the bad stuff you can make it good.

Junior center Zach Edey missed the game due to an illness, but the Boilermakers improved to 12-0 on the season.
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Even without 7-foot-4 junior center Zach Edey, Purdue basketball cruised to a 74-53 victory against New Orleans on Wednesday night in its first-ever game at Mackey Arena as the No. 1 team in the country. 
Making the most of his opportunity, redshirt freshman forward Trey Kaufman-Renn stepped up and led all scorers with a career-high 24 points on 8-of-10 shooting. He also registered two assists, pulled in a pair of offensive rebounds and made eight of his 10 shots from the foul line.
Kaufman-Renn paved the way for a 36-16 advantage in bench points for the Boilermakers, and he scored 17 in the second half as sophomore forward Caleb Furst struggled with foul trouble.
""Especially when Zach's gone, you kind of get more low-post touches,"" Kaufman-Renn said of his scoring output. ""There is kind of a rhythm that you get in the game, the feel of the game. We work on it every day, so I just did the same thing I do any other day."" 
In his second game back from injury, junior forward Mason Gillis was thrust back into the starting lineup as a result of Edey’s absence, but he was aggressive from the jump and scored a team-high nine points in the first half on 3-of-6 shooting. 
He was responsible for seven of Purdue’s first 12 points, including a 3-pointer that capped an 8-0 run in the first six minutes.
""I feel great,"" said Gillis, who scored in double figures for just the second time all season by finishing with 11 points. ""There's definitely ups and downs. If anybody has back problems, you understand it's not fun to deal with especially when there are complications with it."" 
The Boilermakers had to find their footing early, as the Privateers used an onslaught of perimeter shooting to keep the game close in the opening minutes. They hit five of their first eight attempts from beyond the arc, led by junior guard Jordan Johnson, who finished the game with 17 points and made three 3-pointers. 
Johnson kickstarted an 8-0 run that gave New Orleans a 13-12 lead with 12:59 left to play before halftime. However, Purdue dominated the final nine minutes of the first half, and New Orleans had just two points in the paint in the period. 
Despite finishing the game with no points, junior guard Ethan Morton's defensive efforts snuffed out a strong start by the Privateers after taking on the role of defending Johnson. 
""Be that guy that can guard somebody,"" Purdue coach Matt Painter said. ""When you have that impact on the game, you're going to stay with them. Well now, when someone gets going like that and you're the guy who can shut people down, you gotta have the value to not take you out. That's hard, but that's reality. I thought Ethan did a good job."" 
Facing a two-point deficit, the Boilermakers mounted a 24-2 run as the Privateers failed to score in nearly nine minutes of play. A layup by junior forward Tyson Jackson put points on the board for New Orleans to briefly stop the barrage. 
Freshman guard Braden Smith registered eight points in the final six minutes, helping Purdue take a 41-21 lead into the locker room. All six of the team’s scorers in the first half had at least four points, including Kuafman-Renn with seven. 
When the Boilermakers returned to the court, their offense was forced to flow through Kaufman-Renn as both Furst and Gillis picked up two fouls in the second half.
""We've just kind of learned that it's next man up,"" Gillis said. ""You gotta be able to do your job, understand what the team needs from you to win. And then moving forward, anybody is susceptible to foul trouble, so if that happens, then you just keep moving on."" 
Kaufman-Renn played 14 minutes in the final period, going 5-of-6 from the field and hitting 7-of-9 attempts from the foul line. Junior guard Brandon Newman was the only other player for Purdue to score more than two points after halftime. 
By the end of the game, the team finished with a 24-18 rebound margin and scored 38 points in the paint compared to just 18 by New Orleans. With the victory, the Boilermakers improved to 12-0 for just the fourth time in program history. 
""It feels good to just play basketball again,"" said Kaufman-Renn, who didn't play at all last season. ""Obviously, when you're on a really good team, that helps too because you're winning a lot of games."" 
Purdue returns to Mackey Arena on Thursday, Dec. 29, for its final nonconference matchup before entering the bulk of the Big Ten schedule. The team takes on Florida A&M at 4 p.m. ET, and the game will be broadcast on the Big Ten Network.

We are looking forward to him leading our offense here at Purdue.""
