FRISCO - Dallas Cowboys rookie defensive end Sam Williams says he is “OK” after he was involved in a Thursday afternoon car crash in Plano.
But the Cowboys are not going to clear him for the weekend’s game, as first noted by the Dallas News after team owner Jerry Jones told 105.3 The Fan that Williams’ status is dependent on a “concussion” issue.
Police say it is believed that Williams was driving a Corvette near SH 121 and Preston Road - an area not far from the Cowboys team headquarters at The Star in Frisco - when he was hit by another car that may have failed to yield to oncoming traffic.
Williams was taken to a local hospital as a precaution, police said, as was the driver of the other car.
Police, who are examining whether excess speed was a factor in the crash, say neither person appears to have been seriously injured.
Williams, a 23-year-old rookie, has been an important contributor as part of the rotation for the Cowboys' defensive end group in his first season. In April, the Cowboys chose Williams in the second round with the 56th overall pick of the 2022 NFL Draft. Williams, who played college football at Ole Miss, has three sacks this year for the 10-4 Cowboys, who are currently preparing for their NFC East showdown in a Christmas Eve meeting against the 13-1 Philadelphia Eagles this Saturday at AT&T Stadium.

FRISCO - The Dallas Cowboys host the Philadelphia Eagles on Christmas Eve at AT&T Stadium, in a possible playoff preview. … and a debut of a couple of vet newcomers.
New Cowboys wideout Hilton will make his Dallas debut almost two weeks after inking his deal with the team. He should add a much-needed deep threat to quarterback Dak Prescott's arsenal.
And now comes the news that cornerback Mackensie Alexander (along with center Brock Hoffman) is coming up from the practice squad.
Alexander, who might fit best as a slot corner as Dallas demotes Kelvin Joseph to special teams, has been a part-time starter in the NFL after having been a Vikings second-round pick.
Both teams have clinched a postseason berth, although the East title is still mathematically in question. A win for the Eagles and they would clinch the NFC East and the No. 1 overall seed in the conference, including a first-round bye.
Dallas must win its remaining three games while Philly loses its final three in order to win the division. As unlikely as that sounds, it starts with a win on Saturday.
Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts is out after injuring his shoulder in the win over the Bears last week. The injury is described as a sprain, and the MVP candidate isn't expected to much time. 
The Cowboys will be without linebacker Leighton Vander Esch after a neck stinger suffered in the loss against Jacksonville, but defensive end Dorance Armstrong, who injured his knee last week, should be available.
Rookie defensive end Sam Williams was involved in a car accident on Thursday, the Cowboys are ruling him out.

Dallas Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy has heaped praise on receiver CeeDee Lamb as the former Oklahoma Sooner' form has taken off in recent weeks and he’s proved to be the type of player the organization knew he would be.
Bumping up into the leading role on offense after Amari Cooper's trade dump to the Cleveland Browns, Lamb has gone to another level. After some wobbles early in the season, the receiver has found himself, and coach Mike McCarthy puts it down to him simply getting the ball in his hands more often.
""I just think this year, you're seeing CeeDee take the next step because he was given more opportunities,"" McCarthy said. ""I think for a young player, he's been extremely consistent. He's had things to learn from and grow, but I just love the way he plays and the physicality he plays with.""
Interestingly, though, Lamb himself concedes “there were questions.”
“There were questions - you can say it,” he said of his ability to elevate. “If anybody else has questions, feel free to come ask.”
Lamb received his second Pro Bowl nod in his first three seasons as he is on track to have career-highs in all relevant receiver stats. He has already equaled his best touchdown tally (six), his highest reception total, and is only 115 yards from surpassing the most yards in a season with three games to go.
He is doing the No. 88 proud - as McCarthy knew he would.
Said McCarthy: “What I appreciate about CeeDee, is his love for football kind of trumps everything. I've never look at him like, 'OK, he's a 3 that's developing to a 2. It's never been like that.""
Lamb will have his receiver credentials tested on Christmas Eve as the 10-4 Cowboys face the 13-1 Philadelphia Eagles and star corner Darius Slay. Lamb totaled five catches on 10 targets for 68 yards in the corresponding game and will be looking at having a more significant impact at AT&T Stadium.
Many thought he wasn't up to the lofty expectations of being the No. 1 receiver for Dallas, but Lamb has shown that he is more than up for the task.
Now, of course, comes the challenge of doing it again … and again … and again.

https://www.si.com/nfl/cowboys/news/dallas-cowboys-philadelphia-eagles-miles-sanders-jalen-hurts-injury-christmas-eve-dak-prescott-kearse-preview,"Cowboys vs. Eagles: Jalen Hurts OUT, RB Miles Sanders New Dallas Problem?","Philadelphia Eagles running back Miles Sanders has quietly risen to the top of the rushing ranks this season despite having some boom-or-bust performances. Which version could the Dallas Cowboys see on Christmas Eve?
The Dallas Cowboys seemingly caught a break on Thursday after Philadelphia Eagles coach Nick Sirianni announced that star quarterback Jalen Hurts would be unable to suit up for a highly-anticipated Christmas Eve matchup between the two rivals at AT&T Stadium on Saturday.
But while the absence of an MVP candidate like Hurts certainly .... ""hurts"" ... the Eagles, there might not be as much of an advantage for Dallas' defense as some might think. 
Eagles running back Miles Sanders is quietly the fifth-leading rusher in the league this season (1,110 yards) and fourth in rushing touchdowns (11) despite playing alongside arguably the best dual-threat quarterback in the league. And while his numbers clearly don't lie, he's shown he has some true boom-or-bust potential each time he takes the field given how up and down his production has been this season. 
Sanders has three games with at least both 130 rushing yards and two touchdowns. But aside from that, he has had six games of 60 rushing yards or fewer this season. The trips to the end zone haven't decreased, as Sanders has scored in eight games this season. 
It leaves room to wonder which version the Cowboys will see this time around. A look at the first meeting between the two teams this season, which resulted in a 26-17 win for the Eagles, might provide some hints. 
Ultimately, Sanders didn't need to go above and beyond in the first meeting with Dallas. The Eagles leaned on their defense while the offense took advantage of short fields, as he finished with a steady 18 carries for 71 yards and a touchdown. 
But if he managed to come away with a respectable performance like this even in a win dominated by the defense along with the presence of Hurts in the backfield, Sanders could be in for a bigger offensive workload on Saturday.
Meanwhile, the Cowboys D is also in ""which-one-shows-up'' mode.
Said safety Jayron Kearse on Dallas' recent breakdowns: “We have the players to stop that but we didn’t get the job done. We have to figure some things out, especially at this point in the season where the road is not going to get easier.
“Just like we’re watching tape on other guys, they’re watching tape on us. I can assure you right now, they’re licking their chops.”
Now without Hurts to take away carries in the backfield, it could be Sanders' chance to show his ""chops'' ... and Dallas' challenge to ""figure things out.''
The Cowboys (10-4) and Eagles (13-1) kick off at 3:25 p.m. CT.

Among the seven Dallas Cowboys that were selected for the Pro Bowl, no one may have been more surprised about the news than KaVontae Turpin.
Turpin found out about the honor on Wednesday night via a phone call from team owner Jerry Jones. When the rookie answered the phone, Turpin originally thought he was going to be cut after Jones brought up the muffed punt in the come-from-behind win over the Houston Texans two weeks ago.
Instead of receiving the news of a pink slip, though, he got word of his invitation to the NFL's All-Star game. 
""It brought me to tears,"" Turpin said. ""It was like a dream come true.""
The former USFL star earned himself a shot with the Cowboys during training camp. And after flashing on special teams in the preseason, he made it onto the 53-man roster. Now he becomes the first Cowboys player to make the Pro Bowl from the (primary) position of returner. 
Other Cowboys who made the games included: 
Coming off the heartbreaking 40-34 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars in overtime, Turpin and the Cowboys will host the Philadelphia Eagles on Saturday for the Christmas Eve game that is set for a 3:25 p.m. kickoff.

WHITT'S END 12.23.22:
Whether you’re at the end of your coffee, your day, your week or even your rope, welcome to Whitt’s End …
 *The wind chill during the fourth quarter of Thursday night’s Armed Forces Bowl between Baylor and Air Force was a crisp -11 degrees. Otherwise known by two simple words:
 Eff. That.
 While a big part of the U.S. prepares for a white(out) Christmas this weekend, Saturday’s Dallas Cowboys-Philadelphia Eagles anticlimactic “showdown” will be sheltered from this arctic “Blue Norther” inside AT&T Stadium’s climate-controlled 72-degree environment.
 But there was a time – more often and more recently than you remember – when Mother Nature stuck her uncomfortable nose in our Dallas-Fort Worth sports business. As in, it was just last May when a rainy, leaky roof at American Airlines Center delayed Game 4 of the NBA’s Western Conference Finals between the Dallas Mavericks and Golden State Warriors for 16 minutes.
 Our Top 10 most memorable weather “games”:
 10. 12.9.13 – The wind chill at kickoff is a brutal -9 degrees. It turns out to be the good news, as the stiff and shoddy Cowboys’ defense allows 348 passing yards to journeyman Bears’ quarterback Josh McCown in a 45-28 loss at frosty Soldier Field.
 9. 12.22.89 – With the temperature bitterly dipping to 3 outside, Rolando Blackman heats up Reunion Arena with a 31-point performance (without attempting a single 3-pointer) that helps the playoff-bound Mavericks beat the Los Angeles Clippers and improve to 12-12.
 8. 12.24.89 – You know it’s bad when the temperature matches your win total … and both are 1. On the coldest day in DFW history (-1), the Cowboys cap a 1-15 season with a 20-10 loss to the Green Bay Packers. It is so cold that the toilets in Texas Stadium freeze, prompting Dallas sportswriting icon Frank Luksa to opine: “The 1989 season was so bad it wouldn’t flush.”
 7. 2.14.21 – On the coldest Valentine’s Day in DFW history, Luka Doncic spoils a 44-point performance by missing an open 3-pointer that would’ve surely heated up an overtime against the Portland Trailblazers.
 6. 5.3.09 – Though it isn’t a “game” per se, the stormy Spring day results in a permanent, devastating outcome as Cowboys’ scouting assistant Rich Behm is paralyzed from the waist down after a 64-mph wind gust (one degree shy of an official tornado) blows down the team’s Valley Ranch indoor practice structure during a rookie minicamp.
 5. 2.6.11 – A debilitating arctic blast turns DFW into horrible hosts. Frigid temperatures and icy roads hamper travel, cancel events and send six fans to the hospital after ice falls from the roof of then-Cowboys Stadium. At the end of a long, bad week, Cowboys fans have to watch a Super Bowl XLV featuring two of their most-hated teams: Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Green Bay Packers.
 4. 1.17.93 – This wasn’t a wintry mix, but rather pig slop. In a game they aren’t supposed to win and on a field that was barely playable, Alvin Harper sloshes through Candlestick Park’s rain-soaked, muddy sod for a 70-yard catch-and-run that punctuates the Cowboys’ NFC Championship Game upset of the San Francisco 49ers and a ticket to Super Bowl XXVII.
 3. 1.1.79 – Neither hypothermia caused by a sub-freezing wind chill nor a 22-point deficit can stop Joe Montana in the 1979 Cotton Bowl. With Notre Dame trailing Houston, 34-12, late in the third quarter, Montana – with the aid of hot chicken soup – returns from the locker room to lead an improbable rally and a 35-34 victory in a game that sees only 7,000 in attendance and a 30-mph wind dictating every point scored in the south end zone.
 2. 11.25.93 – Leon Lett’s brain freeze. On a turbulent Thanksgiving that surprises fans – and weatherfolks – with an ice storm that transforms Texas Stadium into a snow globe, Lett infamously and inexplicably attempts to recover a blocked field goal in the waning seconds of a heart-breaking, mind-numbing defeat to the Miami Dolphins.
 1. 12.31.67 – Though it’s played 1,000 miles north in a world accustomed to the frozen tundra, the “Ice Bowl” forever burns a painful image in the hearts and minds of Cowboys fans. The 1967 NFL Championship Game at Lambeau Field includes coaching legends Tom Landry and Vince Lombardi, the Packers’ Bart Starr’s game-winning touchdown in the final seconds and a brisk temperature of minus-15.
 *What a buzzkill. Since Dak Prescott returned from his thumb injury in October, we’ve been circling the Cowboys’ Christmas Eve game against the Eagles. Two best teams in football, we thought. NFC East on the line, we figured. 
Now? The 10-4 Cowboys aren’t catching 13-1 Philadelphia, Eagles’ MVP candidate Jalen Hurts isn’t playing and the expected holiday treat of a game has deteriorated into a White Elephant gift. After all, who wants Gardner Minshew in their stocking? 
Can’t we just skip to the part where both teams are motivated and playing at full strength, better known as the NFC Championship Game?
 *While Luka Doncic whines and loses about as often as he wins, Jalen Brunson is suddenly clicking in New York. The former Mav is playing so well that ESPN NBA analyst Michael Wilbon went this far: “Jalen Brunson better be mentioned when you start your MVP discussions. He’s having that good of a season. You think Luka and his .500 team wouldn’t like to have him back?” 
No lies detected. 
And to think, it only cost the Knicks a second-round pick to steal Brunson from Dallas.
*Unfairly Judged? In the wake of catching – and selling – the most valuable baseball on Earth, Texas Rangers fan Cory Youmans sets the record straight about his past, present, future and process of being at peace with only $1.5 million.
Youmans, who caught New York Yankees’ slugger Aaron Judge’s historic 62nd home run at Arlington’s Globe Life Field on Oct. 4, isn’t some romantic baseball hero that voluntarily relinquished the ball out of his love of the game. But nor is he the rich-get-richer villain fittingly hoodwinked out of half his potential windfall, an image being portrayed by the media and amplified across uninformed social networks.
Before selling the ball at an auction that ended last Saturday, Youmans said he received sketchy DM offers for the ball in exchange for things like Ferraris and suitcases full of cash.
“No matter what I did, not everyone would agree that it was the right strategy,” Youmans told me this week. “If I gave it back I was stupid, and if I sold it I was greedy. I’m a private person that essentially won the lottery live on national TV. So, to say the least, it’s been an interesting experience. But at the end of the day, I feel lucky to have been in the stadium that night and lucky to have caught the ball.
""I’m at peace with the process.”
As the Rangers prepare for a 2023 season they hope breaks a streak of six losing campaigns, they’re creating another buzz with more offseason spending. Last winter it was half-a-billion dollars for Seager and Marcus Semien. This year they signed a bona-fide pitching ace in New York Mets’ former two-time Cy Young winner Jacob deGrom.
By the time they host their first ever Sunday Night Baseball game at Globe Life Field on April 2, the gnashing of teeth over Youmans’ perceived error in selling strategy will be long gone. His profit, however, will still be hard at work.
His plans include using some of the money for he and wife Bri’s first home together, and re-paying a grandfather who delayed retirement in order to see Youmans through high school. Youmans wants to build him a garage for his passion: working on classic cars.
“I want part of this money to allow him to do what he loves for as long as he wants to do it,” he said.
Youmans will gladly keep the fortune. But he’s had his fill of the fame.
“One minute you’re standing in line for a cheeseburger and the next minute everyone is trying uncover every wrinkle of your life,” Youmans said. “If a Google search says this is my No. 1 accomplishment, I’m fine with that. I don’t expect to go on and do something else that gets me on Good Morning America.
“This was enough for me.”
*Took Big Brothers Big Sisters lil’ bro Ja Christmas shopping this week. What’s on a 16-year-old boy’s wish list: Crocs. $50 Crocs. I remember when they were $8 and ugly. Now they’re $50 and still as hideous.
*Duncanville finally de-fanged its Houston nemesis and Dallas County schools went 3 for 3 in last weekend’s high school football state championships in Arlington. The Panthers, Desoto and South Oak Cliff all won titles in their divisions. Amazingly, the three schools are separated by less than 15 miles.
 *How much does Cowboys owner Jerry Jones love Christmas? This much: “I have lights everywhere I can fit ’em, and I’ve been known to leave ’em up past Valentine’s.”
 *Hot.
 *Not.
 *When I was a kid the Pro Bowl mattered. Couldn’t wait to see how many Cowboys made it. But in this era of endless stats-driven grades, Madden ratings and Top 100 player lists, it’s downshifted to a sideshow afterthought. 
It’s a convoluted voting system, and the actual game is being replaced by something called the Pro Bowl Games featuring skills competitions. 
If the Pro Bowl was a horse, we’d shoot it to put it out of its misery.
 *Forget Winter Storm “Elliott”, Texans are bracing for a rare event that will deal an even more severe blow to their holiday spirits. 
Liquor stores, closed?! For 61 consecutive hours??!! Twice in two weeks???!!!
Beer and wine sales are a go, 24/7. But liquor in Texas – thanks, silly Prohibition leftovers – is a different animal. Can’t buy it on Sundays or major holidays, such as, sure enough, Christmas and New Year’s Day. Here’s the double whammy: When those holidays, like this year, fall on a Sunday, sales are also banned the following Monday. Bottom line: Texas liquor stores will close at 9 p.m. Saturday and not re-open until Tuesday at 10 a.m. Same routine for Dec. 31 through Jan. 3. 
Binge-buy accordingly.
 *Four Mavs are candidates for the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2023: Dirk Nowitzki, Michael Finley, Shawn Marion and Dick Motta. Dirk will get in. Motta should but won’t.
 *I have a friend. Let’s call her, um, “Lucky.” On Dec. 22, 2021 she got COVID and had to inform her family, who was en route to her house. Thursday was Dec. 22, 2022 and guess who tested positive for COVID? Should we tell her family or make her do it again?
 *In August 2001 the Rangers offered slugger Joey Gallo a five-year, $100 million contract that he turned down. Last week he signed with the Minnesota Twins: one year, $11 million. Ouch.
 *A year ago on Christmas it was 84 degrees. For some strange reason I felt moved to keep a receipt.
*I live nearby and often have to navigate the dicey Highway 121/Preston Road intersection where Cowboys’ linebacker Sam Williams was involved in an accident Thursday. Williams was taken to the hospital but is apparently okay. Lots of speed and ego squeezed into that mesh-point. Tread lightly.
 *Hey, people who just couldn’t wait for “sweater weather” and the leaves to turn and pumpkin-flavored everything in the Fall, these single-digit temps are your fault. Hope you’re happy. And freezing.
 *Next Thursday is a sports version of a partial eclipse when – for the first time I can remember – the Cowboys (at the Tennessee Titans) and Texas Longhorns (vs. Washington in The Alamo Bowl) play at the same time. Why isn’t picture-in-picture still a thing?
 *Merry Christmas! No, Santa Claus ain’t real. But his “spirit” is as tangible as ever.
 *This Weekend? Friday let’s get festive with friends old and new. Saturday let’s visit the parents in JoCo MoFo while keeping an eye on Cowboys-Eagles. Sunday let’s have a traditional Thanksgiving meal on Christmas, because why not? As always, don’t be a stranger.

https://www.si.com/nfl/cowboys/news/dallas-cowboys-rookie-sam-williams-car-accident,Cowboys Rookie Involved in Car Accident,"Williams was taken to a local hospital as a precaution, police said, as was the driver of the other car.
FRISCO - Dallas Cowboys rookie defensive end Sam Williams was involved in a Thursday afternoon car crash in Plano, as first reported by WFAA.
Police tell the media outlet it is believed that Williams was driving a Corvette near SH 121 and Preston Road - an area not far from the Cowboys team headquarters at The Star in Frisco - when he was hit by another car that may have failed to yield to oncoming traffic.
Williams was taken to a local hospital as a precaution, police said, as was the driver of the other car.
Police, who are examining whether excess speed was a factor in the crash, say neither person appears to have been seriously injured.
Williams, a 23-year-old rookie, has been an important contributor as part of the rotation for the Cowboys' defensive end group in his first season. In April, the Cowboys chose Williams in the second round with the 56th overall pick of the 2022 NFL Draft. Williams, who played college football at Ole Miss, has three sacks this year for the 10-4 Cowboys, who are currently preparing for their NFC East showdown in a Christmas Eve meeting against the 13-1 Philadelphia Eagles this Saturday at AT&T Stadium.

Dallas Cowboys ""Lion-backer'' Micah Parsons is dealing with opposing offenses doing everything they can to slow him down. Over the last month, it has worked, as Parsons' blistering sack pace has slowed dramatically.
Asked to be more a pass-rusher than a traditional linebacker, Parsons is now dealing with the physical aspects of that switch, with the player himself acknowledging the challenges it brings.

""It's going to be a constant for the rest of his career,"" McCarthy said. ""I think it's a great position to be in. When you're the focal point of the opponent, it obviously speaks volumes of your ability and how you can affect the game.""
The immediate good news on Parsons: He's been ill this week and missed two days of workouts, but returned to practice on Thursday in preparation for Saturday's visit from the Eagles. The rest of the Cowboys/Eagles injury report, with Jalen Hurts now officially out  ...
Parsons started the year with eight sacks in just seven games as the former Penn State star was a game-wrecker. But since then - even though he justifiably made the Pro Bowl - teams have figured out a way to slow him down.
Running the football takes away Parsons' ability to rush the passer, and with the Cowboys struggling to stop the run, Micah has been reduced to a bystander of late.
Teams have also run the ball straight at Micah on read-option plays to force the linebacker to make a choice instead of straight-up pass rushing ... and it's worked.
In his last three outings, Parsons has just one sack, nine combined tackles, one tackle for loss, and three quarterback hits. Good numbers ... but not ""Micah numbers.''
Part of that is the physical toll, as Parsons is getting worn down (along with the illness, it's a good bet that his sore shoulder is just one of many ailing body parts). But McCarthy says the linebacker is getting through it.
​""As far as the chips and all those things, that's a big part of our self-scout each and every week. He's handling it.""

https://www.si.com/nfl/cowboys/news/dallas-cowboys-ronnie-hillman-dies-super-bowl-champion-denver-broncos,Broncos & Cowboys Ex Ronnie Hillman Dies,"Former NFL running back Ronnie Hillman was diagnosed with an aggressive form of kidney cancer in August.
Former NFL running back Ronnie Hillman, who was part of the Peyton Manning-led Denver Broncos team that won Super Bowl 50, died on Wednesday at the age of 31.
His family released a statement via Hillman's Instagram account:
“It is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of our beloved son, brother & father, Ronnie K Hillman Jr.,” the family statement reads. “Ronnie quietly and peacefully transitioned today in the company of his family and close friends. We as the family, appreciate the prayers and kind words that have already been expressed. We ask that you would give us time to process our feelings as we prepare to lay our precious RJ to rest.”
The San Diego State product was diagnosed with renal medullary carcinoma -- a rare form of kidney cancer that predominantly affects African Americans with the sickle cell trait -- in August, and had been transferred to hospice care earlier this week.
After a successful career with the Aztecs, Hillman was drafted by the Broncos in 2012. He was part of the Denver squad that lost Super Bowl 48 to the Seattle Seahawks.
Hillman had his most successful NFL season in 2015, rushing for 863 yards and seven touchdowns. The Broncos would claim a 24-10 Super Bowl 50 victory over the Carolina Panthers.
Hillman was released by the Broncos in 2016 and played for the Minnesota Vikings and San Diego Chargers before joining the Dallas Cowboys during the 2017 offseason. Hillman was cut before the season began and retired from professional football.

Diggs is the first Dallas cornerback to earn consecutive Pro Bowl selections since Deion Sanders (1996-99).
