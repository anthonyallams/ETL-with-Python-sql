https://www.si.com/nfl/49ers/news/49ers-rb-jordan-mason-is-questionable-for-saturday-with-a-hamstring-injury,Jordan Mason is Questionable for Saturday with a Hamstring Injury,"Now, the 49ers don't necessarily have a clear-cut No. 2 running back.
This is a surprise.
Jordan Mason injured his hamstring Wednesday during practice and had to leave. Now the 49ers list him as questionable to play Saturday against the Washington Commanders. 
It's unclear how severe Mason's injury is, but it seems unlikely the 49ers would push him to play through a soft-tissue injury just a few days after pulling it, especially considering they already clinched the division and the No. 3 seed.
""Anybody who has an injury that could risk them for the following week -- definitely rest them,"" head coach Kyle Shanahan said this week.
Which means there's a significant chance Mason won't play on Saturday. And Mason has been the 49ers' most explosive and consistent runner this season -- he's averaging an outrageous 6.6 yards per carry. And while the 49ers don't give him a ton of carries, the past few weeks he had established himself as the clear-cut No. 2 running back behind Christian McCaffrey.
Now, the 49ers don't necessarily have a clear-cut No. 2 running back. Instead, they'll have rookie Ty Davis-Price who's averaging 2.3 yards per carry, and veteran Tevin Coleman who's averaging 2.2 yards per carry. One of those two will have to play, because the 49ers probably don't want to give McCaffrey a huge workload until the playoffs.
It will be interesting to see how the 49ers run game performs if Mason can't go. Because if the 49ers don't run the ball well and can't use play action and Purdy has to drive the offense as a drop-back passer against a talented defensive line, the 49ers could be in trouble.
This game will be the 49ers' biggest test until the postseason.","Sports Illustrated San Francisco 49ers News, Analysis and More","San francisco 49ers, Jordan mason, News",Grant cohn,"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 00:04:39 GMT","Now, the 49ers don't necessarily have a clear-cut No. 2 running back.",https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NjM0MDQ4ODY4NDU5Njgy/my-post-1-37.jpg
https://www.si.com/nfl/49ers/news/will-the-san-francisco-49ers-impeach-the-washington-commanders,Will the 49ers Impeach the Commanders?,"The Commanders have the best defense that the 49ers have faced all season.
Last Thursday Night in Seattle, Trent Williams closed out his hype speech by yelling: ""Trenches on three!""
That might be an even bigger key this Saturday at Levi's Stadium versus the Commanders on Christmas Eve.
The Commanders have the best defense that the 49ers have faced all season, other than Week 3 at the Broncos in Denver. And Chase Young will make his season debut, so this Commanders D could arguably be the best that the 49ers offense has faced in 2022. Brock Purdy didn't play until week 13 against the Dolphins, so this will be by far the best defense that he has ever faced. Much like the 49ers, the Commanders have invested heavily in their defensive line. Montez Sweat (7 sacks), Jonathan Allen (7.5 sacks) and Daron Payne (8.5 sacks) all are monsters. Chase Young was the No. 1 pick in 2020 when he won Defensive Rookie of the Year. They will pose a gigantic challenge in the trenches for the 49ers offensive line and Purdy. Luckily, Purdy is mobile. He will likely need every bit of speed and quickness in order to survive and possibly thrive, in this game.
The 49ers defensive line is playing very well, too. If they aren't quite as talented as the their opponent's front four, then they more than make up for it with their back seven. Dre Greenlaw is best linebacker in football right now and even he can't cover the middle of the field as well as Fred Warner does. Azeez Al-Shaair is easily the most talented third linebacker in the NFL. Talanoa Hufanga is arguably a top five safety. Jimmie Ward has been a man possessed for the past two or three games at nickel cornerback since getting his club off and getting his game shape on. Charvarius ""Mooney"" Ward is flat out the best tackling cornerback this season. His coverage ability is nothing short of elite as well. Hopefully he will be able to play after sustaining a concussion last Thursday night, which gives him nine days to recover. The last I knew, the average return from concussion protocol took about eight days, but the rules have gotten a lot more strict since then. Charvarius Ward was limited in practice on Tuesday, which I took as a good sign that he would play. This was an even better sign from Wednesday:
If the 49ers starting front four isn't quite as prolific, then their depth is likely quite bit a better. Kalia Davis is back at practice off the non-football injury list. He is a DJ Jones clone, with similar height, weight, combine statistics and even the quick get off when the ball is snapped. Davis even wears Jones' old No. 93. One thing that might make the 49ers starting four rival those of the Commanders would be if Javon Kinlaw were able to play. We can't count on him, but there is some hope. 
Nick Bosa is finally getting attention as being most deserving of the Defensive Player of the Year Award for 2022. 
Arik Armstead is so underrated. He constantly eats double-teams, both as a run-stuffer and as a pass-rusher. Samson Ebukam is a solid pass-rusher and one the best run-stuffing edge players. Charles Omenihu is adept at rushing the quarterback off the edge or up the middle. Rookie Drake Jackson has one of the highest sack rates for any first year player and some of the most batted balls, too.
On offense, the Commanders aren't nearly as scary, despite having wide receiver Terry McLaurin aka ""Scary Terry"", who has already eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards. Curtis Samuel has 789 combined yards and four touchdowns. Brian Robinson Jr. is a very impressive rookie running back and Jahan Dotson is a solid rookie wide receiver who has six touchdown catches on just 23 receptions which is about eight times the rate McLauren who has three touchdown catches on 104 receptions. Outside of that big four, the Commanders don't have many other weapons that Taylor Heinicke can rely upon. Heinicke reminds me of a fair amount of Purdy mixed with some of Jimmy Garoppolo. If Heinicke struggles, then I wouldn't be surprised if we see Carson Wentz. He's not very good, but he did beat the 49ers in 2020 as an Eagle. If I'm being honest, then I'd say that Nick Mullens lost that game by throwing a pick, losing a fumble and throwing a pick-six. Wentz also beat the 49ers in 2021 as a Colt. There again, the 49ers quarterback lost the game. This time it was Garoppolo by throwing two picks and losing a fumble in a monsoon. I don't think that Wentz will beat us, but losing to him three straight seasons, on three different teams, would be super embarrassing, if not historic!
The 49ers will be without Deebo Samuel, but against the Broncos they were without Christian McCaffrey who has been the best 49ers offensive player this season, so they should be at least slightly better off. 
Purdy seems to be better than Garoppolo, especially in play action, so that's another advantage. Tarvarius Moore was back to practice as a limited participant, so that could boost special teams. So could the return of Samuel Womack from the concussion protocol. Mike McGlinchey is always a concern, but he played pretty well against the Seahawks, so hopefully he can build off that. Center Jake Brendel and the the rest of the 49ers interior offensive line hasn't faced a pair of defensive tackles like this all season. Vita Vea was supposed to be a challenge, but he got injured almost immediately two weeks ago. 
The Commanders are very similar to the 49ers, but just not quite as good on either side of the ball. As of now, I'm picking the 49ers to impeach the Commanders, but that's assuming that Charvarius Ward will play. It should be low scoring game -- 17 points might just be enough to win it.
I will reply to this article with my official score prediction, about an hour prior to kickoff, once we know exactly who will play and who won't.","Sports Illustrated San Francisco 49ers News, Analysis and More","San francisco 49ers, News, Washington commanders",Ted hazelrig,"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 18:29:49 GMT",The Commanders have the best defense that the 49ers have faced all season.,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NjI4ODQzMDk5NjYxODQ4/my-post-1-33.jpg

The NFL just released the rosters for the upcoming Pro Bowl, and the following six 49ers made it: Nick Bosa, Talanoa Hufanga, Kyle Juszczyk, George Kittle, Fred Warner and Trent Williams.
In addition, the following 49ers were selected as NFC Pro Bowl alternates: Christian McCaffrey, Deebo Samuel, Charvarius Ward, Jake Brendel, Robbie Gould, Mitch Wishnowsky and Ray-Ray McCloud.
Here's my instant analysis of these selections:
1. Good for Talanoa Hufanga, who made the Pro Bowl in his first season as a starter. Plus, he's one of only three safeties who made the NFC team along with Quadre Diggs and Budda Baker. That's heady stuff.
2. Christian McCaffrey should be more than a mere alternate -- he should have made the team over Cowboys running back Tony Pollard.
3. Charvarius Ward also should have made the team over Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander. Ward is just as essential to the 49ers secondary as Hufanga.
4. Jake Brendel absolutely deserves to be a Pro Bowl alternate. His peers clearly respect him, because I doubt many fans voted for him. He's a relative no-name.
5. Deebo Samuel is an alternate purely based on reputation. He has had a down season. Brandon Aiyuk should have been an alternate over him.
6. Three 49ers specialists made the team, as they should. They've been terrific all season, especially McCloud, the return man.
7. Poor Dre Greenlaw. He didn't even make the team as an alternate even though he has played better than Fred Warner this season. What a shame.

The 49ers are having one of the most interesting seasons in franchise history, and lots of their fans simply want to speculate about the upcoming offseason. Forget that the 49ers have the best defense in franchise history. Forget that they're playing their rookie third-string quarterback who was the last pick in the draft and currently is undefeated. Forget that in 15 years, 49ers fans still will say, ""Remember 2022?""
Let's honor this generational story by not speculating about how it might end and what will happen afterward. All that fruitless speculation only takes away from the drama and passion of this season. 
This is an official moratorium on 49ers-related hypotheticals, particularly ""what ifs"" such as the following:
1. What if Brock Purdy wins the Super Bowl? Does that mean he automatically wins the starting job over Trey Lance next season?
2. What if Kyle Shanahan wins the Super Bowl with a rookie third-string quarterback? Would that mean Shanahan is better than Bill Walsh?
3. What if Purdy makes it to the NFC Championship game but not the Super Bowl? Would there be a quarterback competition?
4. What if Lance gets upset and demands a trade?
5. What if Jimmy Garoppolo's market dries up yet again and the 49ers sign him to another one-year deal?
6. What if DeMeco Ryans becomes a head coach? Who will replace him?
7. What if Purdy gets injured in the playoffs? Will Garoppolo come back and save the day, or will Josh Johnson play and be better than Purdy?
8. What if Elijah Mitchell is fully healthy next season? Will he split carries with Christian McCaffrey?
9. What if the 49ers can't re-sign Emmanuel Moseley or Jimmie Ward?

SANTA CLARA -- The 49ers opened Javon Kinlaw's practice window today, which means they have three weeks to get him ready to play football and activate him from the Injured Reserve List.
Here's what head coach Kyle Shanahan said Tuesday about Kinlaw's impending return.
Q: Is the plan to get him playing right away or are you going to use a little more of that window?
SHANAHAN: ""No, as soon as he looks good and is ready to go, we'll play him.""
Q: How has Kinlaw handled not being able to play and making his way back?
SHANAHAN: ""I think as good as anyone can. It's been so frustrating for him. It's been a long battle going back to the Cowboys game from a couple years ago. I know he feels as good as he has felt. I know how hard he has worked to get to this point. I know how pumped he is to have the opportunity to come back and be part of a playoff team. Just talking to him this morning, he is geared up and ready to go as good as I've seen him and his spirits are high.""
Q: Asking just because Kinlaw has had setbacks, but is there a high level of confidence that he can actually play, or will you see how he responds to practice?
SHANAHAN: ""There's high level (confidence) that he can play, but that's the whole thing with what he has been going through with his knee -- can he do it without having it flaring up and having setbacks? That's why we've been very patient with the rehab. He has been very consistent with it, and we've been able to do it for a while here without any setbacks, and we've done as much as we can. The only thing left for him to do is put pads on and go out there and play.

The NFL will announce the Pro Bowl rosters this Wednesday at 5:00, and at least six 49ers should make it, considering they led their positions in fan votes. Here are those six 49ers:
Christian McCaffrey, Kyle Juszczyk, Trent Williams, George Kittle, Nick Bosa and Fred Warner.
Six Pro Bowlers normally would be quite an honor for an NFL team, but not the 49ers. This team has at least 10 players that deserve Pro Bowl selections. Here are four more 49ers who should make it and could make it once the league counts the votes from the players and coaches.
Linebacker Dre Greenlaw
The No. 1 defense in the league has to have more than just two Pro Bowlers, and Greenlaw is the 49ers' leading tackler. He also is tied for the team lead in forced fumbles and fumble recoveries. He arguably is the 49ers' best linebacker -- he just doesn't have the name recognition Fred Warner has.
Safety Talanoa Hufanga
He has intercepted four passes this season -- only four players have intercepted more -- and has allowed a passer rating of just 63.5. He also has 8 pass breakups, 5 tackles for loss and one touchdown all in his first season as a starter. He is the biggest playmaker in the 49ers' back seven
Cornerback Charvarius Ward
The 49ers' No. 1 cornerback has given up a measly 6.7 yards per target and broken up a team-high 11 passes.
Safety/nickelback Jimmie Ward
The 49ers' starting free safety last season missed the first five games of this season due to injury, switched to nickelback midseason. And during the 49ers' current seven-game win-streak, he has allowed a passer rating of just 61.1. He's playing out of position and performing better than ever. So even though he missed five games, he deserves his first Pro Bowl selection. He's overdue.","Sports Illustrated San Francisco 49ers News, Analysis and More","Jimmie ward, Dre greenlaw, Charvarius ward, News, San francisco 49ers, Talanoa hufanga",Grant cohn,"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 19:08:38 GMT","Six Pro Bowlers normally would be quite an honor for an NFL team, but not the 49ers.",https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NTgzMDgzMTc1OTEyOTg0/my-post-1-26.jpg
https://www.si.com/nfl/49ers/news/why-the-49ers-are-no-longer-sweepless-in-seattle,Why the 49ers Are No Longer Sweepless in Seattle,"Maybe it was just Russell Wilson.
It started out looking as if the Seahawks star crossed luck form their last decade of dominance over the 49ers was right on track. On their opening drive, Dre Greenlaw dropped what looked like a relatively easy pick. Mistake No. 1.
Luckily, the 49ers defense stiffened by holding the Seahawks to a five and out which only netted seven yards
I started to feel a little bit better, until the 49ers went three and out which only netted nine yards.
Geno Smith's offense was futile on the next drive, producing another three and out.
This was not the recipe for success, at arguably to the toughest venue for visiting teams in the NFL.
The next 49ers drive was magic. It began with a play action pass to Christian McCaffrey, then a nifty 23 -yard McCaffrey run and it culminated with a pass from Brock Purdy to George Kittle down the middle, after Purdy pumped left, then pumped right, which left Kittle all alone, to rumble to pay dirt from 28 yards out. Purdy looked like a seasoned veteran quarterback, maybe even a bit like one who wore No. 16.
On the subsequent drive, Talanoa Hufanga had an 11 yard strip sack, but the Seahawks tackle Abraham Lewis managed to recover the ball. Another three and out.
Due to a Seahawk penalty, the 49ers began the next drive at midfield. The drive stalled at fourth and seven on the Seahawks 47. The 49ers lined up to run a play. I said they must be trying to get the Seahawks to jump offsides, which did happen. Instead of going for it on fourth and two, Kyle elected to punt and the punt ended up as touchback. I thought Kyle made a big mistake to waste that fourth and two in plus territory. Mistake No. 2.
Despite leading 7-0, I was beginning to get nervous. Lumen Field is not the kind of place where teams that squander multiple gifted opportunities tend to win with much frequency.
The Seahawks went three and out yet again.
The 49ers next drive sputtered and Purdy ended throwing a ball right on the numbers to Quandre Diggs, who dropped it. To me, this was the play of the game. the score easily could've been 7-7, or 7-3, instead it was still 7-0.
The next Seahawks drive got them a field goal, making it seven to three.
Then the 49ers punted on the next drive.
The Seahawks began on their own 19 yard line and got out their 41, where Jimmie Ward hit Travis Homer and Dre Greenlaw came flying in with big hit to knock the ball loose. This was the second biggest play of the game and the biggest one by a 49er.
Charvarius Ward scooped the fumble up and returned it for 40 yards to the Seahawks six yard line. A pair of runs by McCaffrey got him to the promised land. 
It was now 14-3, instead of 7-6, or 7-10. That's a 7 to 14 point swing in what would turn out to be only be an 8 point game. 
The Seahawks punted to end the 1st half, with the 49ers set to receive the kickoff to begin the second half.
Purdy struck on the second play of the second half, when he hit Kittle for a 54 yard touchdown, making it 21-3. It was vintage a vintage Kittle rumble!
The Refs bailed Geno Smith out on the next drive. Nick Bosa pressured him and he threw a pick six to Deommodore Lenoir. Instead of it being 28-3, the Seahawks retained possession due to a highly questionable roughing the passer call on Bosa.
They ended up driving most of the length of the field, before settling for a field goal making it 21-6, with 8:13 to go in the third quarter, despite a Bosa 11-yard sack.
Besides the Geno Smith touchdown to Noah Fant with 3:39 in the fourth quarter to make it 21-13, the rest of the second half half, leading up to that, was pretty uneventful.
I had a feeling that they would kick the ball away, rather than attempt an onside kick which has such a low probability of success. 
Could Purdy sustain a drive to kill the clock? I was more than a little bit nervous. 
McCaffrey ran for six and for three. On third and one, Purdy scrambled right for that single yard. He extended the ball slightly beyond the line to gain, just prior to his knee being down. 
  Many NFL veteran quarterbacks wouldn't have had that kind of presence of mind to do something such as this. For a seventh round rookie quarterback to do this, in just his second start, with the game on the line, was nothing short of astounding.
Jordan Mason ran left for six yards on first down, taking the clock to the two minute warning. Then on second and four Mason ripped off a gargantuan 55 yard run to the Seahawks two yard line, to ice the game.
  Maybe it was just Russell Wilson, as the 49ers last sweep of the Seahawks was in 2011 before he was drafted and the most recent sweep this season, the first season that Wilson has been gone to the Broncos. Some people are comparing Purdy to Wilson. Wouldn't it be great if he could keep the 49ers from being swept by the Seahawks for the next eleven seasons?
The Cards have been eliminated, The Rams might be next. The Seahawks appear to be very unlikely to make the playoffs with the Chiefs next up next for them and Tyler Lockett likely out for a while, with a broken hand. All is right in the world of theNFC West, with the 49ers clinching it in Seattle and at securing at least the No. 3 seed in NFC playoffs, by being no longer sweepless in Seattle.","Sports Illustrated San Francisco 49ers News, Analysis and More","News, Seattle seahawks, San francisco 49ers",Ted hazelrig,"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 22:11:44 GMT",Maybe it was just Russell Wilson.,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NDc4NDU4MzA5NDUzNDg5/my-post-1-13.jpg

We don't know how good Brock Purdy ultimately will be, but the 22-year-old rookie already manages games like a 30-year-old veteran.
And that's remarkable, considering his predecessor, Jimmy Garoppolo, who's 31, often managed games like a rookie. He made erratic decisions, didn't see the whole field and seemed to get anxious if his first read wasn't open, which are big reasons the 49ers never won the Super Bowl with him.
Purdy is quite different. He exudes a zen-like calmness and confidence on the field, and he's in complete control of the 49ers offense as if he's been on the team for five or six seasons. That's why he was able to hurry the offense to the line of scrimmage and draw an offside penalty on fourth down against the Seahawks. It's also why he was able to scramble for a first down AND slide in bounds to keep the clock running at the end of the game. The game moves slowly for him and he knows what he's doing.
""I was so impressed with how he managed it in that noise,"" said head coach Kyle Shanahan. ""That was his first time in that situation with all our motions and stuff and having to do the silent count and things like that, getting in and out of the huddle, and I think we only had to use one timeout throughout the whole game. He did a really impressive job.""
Purdy seemed completely impervious to the Seattle homefield advantage that made so many previous 49ers quarterbacks crumble.
So while Purdy may or may not have the physical ability to be a franchise quarterback who makes the big bucks and carries the 49ers for a decade, he doesn't need to carry them now -- they're stacked. He just needs to keep managing games and the 49ers will keep winning.","Sports Illustrated San Francisco 49ers News, Analysis and More","San francisco 49ers, Brock purdy, News",Grant cohn,"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 00:05:21 GMT","Purdy exudes a zen-like calmness and confidence on the field, and he's in complete control of the 49ers offense as if he's been on the team for five or six seasons.",https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NTQxNDcyMTkxMDk2MTk1/my-post-1-19.jpg

Jimmie Ward is the Rodney Dangerfield of the 49ers defense.
He gets no respect. He plays at an elite level every week and no one seems to talk about him because he's on a team full of stars.
But Ward is a star, too. Last season, he played safety and was ranked the 96th-best player in the NFL by his peers. This season, he lost his starting job at free safety when he got injured -- something that's not supposed to happen. Then he begrudgingly moved to nickelback midseason. And in his first game back by from a broken hand, he got torched by Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs.
Since that game, the 49ers haven't lost, and Ward is a big reason for that. During this seven-game winning streak, Ward has given up just 235 receiving yards, zero touchdown catches and a passer rating of 61.1 while intercepting two passes and forcing one fumble. Suddenly, he has become a lock-down nickelback AND a legitimate a playmaker for the first time in his career.
""Everyone knows how good of a safety he is,"" head coach Kyle Shanahan said. ""That's why he more than deserved to be one of the top 100 players in the league last year. Now we're able to use his versatility at nickel when we really need it. And I personally think it puts him in position to have more opportunities to make plays. He's the best down there. I thought his best game of the year was versus Tampa. He was all over the place and he continues to do it. I can't say enough good things about Jimmie. He's been one of our best players this year.""
Ward is one of the few players in the NFL who's top notch at two positions, and he'll be a free agent this offseason, which means he might be too expensive for the 49ers to re-sign.

https://www.si.com/nfl/49ers/news/kyle-shanahan-says-49ers-rb-jordan-masons-time-will-come,Kyle Shanahan Says Jordan Mason's Time Will Come,"The time is now.
The 49ers have two good running backs, but one of them hardly plays.
Jordan Mason is averaging an astounding 6.6 yards per carry for the 49ers this season. And yet this past Thursday night, the 49ers gave him just four carries while they gave 26 to Christian McCaffrey.
McCaffrey is an excellent running back, but he's not built to carry the ball 26 times per game. He's not built like Derrick Henry -- Mason is. Mason needs to carry the ball more frequently down the stretch, particularly to keep McCaffrey fresh for the playoffs.
I asked Kyle Shanahan on a conference call about Mason. Here's exchange we had:
ME: Christian McCaffrey said he calls Jordan Mason ""Mariano Rivera,"" like he's the closer. Is there something he needs to do to earn more carries earlier in the game or is Christian just too good to take off the field? 
SHANAHAN: “No, we can give him more carries earlier in the game. We’ve mixed him in for a few in the weeks before. It was just tough in this game with how much we like Christian in the pass game also and just the threat that he is on the field, but no, his time will come. We usually use everybody.” 
MY INTERPRETATION: Shanahan was desperate to win the division this past Thursday, so he overused McCaffrey, his security blanket. Shanahan is afraid to use Mason because he's a rookie and Shanahan doesn't trust rookies unless he has to. But now that the 49ers have clinched a playoff berth, Shanahan can feature Mason more frequently because they have nothing to lose. Plus he's terrific.
I expect Mason's time to come now.","Sports Illustrated San Francisco 49ers News, Analysis and More","San francisco 49ers, Jordan mason, News",Grant cohn,"Sat, 17 Dec 2022 22:33:50 GMT",The time is now.,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NTE2NjcxMTcwMzU2NjEx/my-post-1-17.jpg
