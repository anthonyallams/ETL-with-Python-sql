One of the best ways to evaluate a team's recruiting efforts is to look at how it stacked classes on top of each other. It gives far more context to how a team is building its roster, and Notre Dame's defense has loaded up on big time talent in the 2022 and 2023 classes.
Position grades for the class are based on the player grades coming out of high school, not based on what the previous class has done, or not done, in college. Grades are based on how well Notre Dame met its needs, the talent of the group and fit. One adjustment is that players in the 2022 class will be listed where they are currently playing.
Here are the two-year grades for the Notre Dame defense:
Grade: B+Signees (8): Josh Burnham (2022), Tyson Ford (2022), Aiden Gobaira (2022), Donovan Hinish (2022), Devan Houstan (2023), Armel Mukam (2023), Boubacar Traore (2023), Brenan Vernon (2023)
This is a very unique blend of recruiting classes for the Irish defensive line. The 2022 class, which now has Josh Burnham as part of the group, had three players that I gave Top 100 caliber grades too. That includes Burnham, Ford and Gobaira. The 2023 group brings a lot more side, equally high ceilings, but it's also a group that adds a lot of size to the unit.
I'm very curious to see how Notre Dame plans to run the defense moving forward. If they start using more of the hybrid 3-3 that Marcus Freeman ran in 2021 as the DC, this grade would actually go up even more. You have a lot of big, power ends that would thrive in a 3-down look, but not a lot of pure edge players outside of Burnham, and potentially Junior Tuihalamaka, who right now I still have listed as a linebacker.
Speaking of Burnham, he has exceptional length and athleticism for the position, but obviously he is raw since he played quarterback and middle linebacker in high school. He has the athletic traits to be a star, but the question is whether or not the position will become natural for him. Gobaira is a long, twitchy edge player that has to fill out and Ford is a power player with a lot of upside. Hinish is a high motor player with better athleticism than his brother.
The 2023 class added a much-needed infusion of power and size. Vernon and Traore have extremely high ceilings, Houstan has a chance to be a standout inside either at 3-technique or the nose, and Mukam is another raw but toolsy player. I talk a lot about upside and potential with this class, and that's what makes it exciting, but the fact I have to focus so much on potential and tools, and not as much on proven ability or the ability to help immediately is what drags this grade down a tad, as does the fact there isn't a true nose player in the group. 
Grade: ASignees (6): Jaylen Sneed (2022), Junior Tuihalamaka (2022), Nolan Ziegler (2022), Jaiden Ausberry (2023), Drayk Bowen (2023), Preston Zinter (2023)
Notre Dame signed one of the two to three best linebacker hauls in the country each of the last two seasons. I had the 2022 haul as the best in the land, but that changes with Burnham moved to defensive end. It's still one of the best, just not clearly the very best without him. But when you look at this two-year haul together you see versatility, tons of talent and a whole lot of athleticism.
Sneed is the most physically gifted player of this group, possessing elite athleticism and loads of potential. He's not quite as nuanced at the position as most of the other players at the group, but his ceiling is exceptionally high. Ausberry and Bowen in the 2023 class are also exceptionally toolsy and grade out as Top 100 recruits on the IB Board. That gives Notre Dame three players to earn that grade, or better, and Ziegler wasn't that far off. The amount of athleticism and range in that foursome is truly outstanding.
We will see if this group can emerge as impact players, but we won't be hearing criticisms about the lack of athleticism at linebacker in the future the way the staff has recruited the position since Freeman arrived. 
Tuihalamaka isn't the athlete the other players are, but he's huge, instinctive and a thumper. We'll see if he sticks at linebacker, but if he does he brings a needed power profile to the group. Zinter is a sleeper pickup, and one that could surprise some people thanks to his length, strong all-around athleticism and versatility.
Grade: ASignees (4): Jaden Mickey (2022), Benjamin Morrison (2022), Micah Bell (2023), Christian Gray (2023)
This had been a concern for the Irish program for years, but Mike Mickens has quickly turned it into a strength. Mickens has landed three strong cornerback classes in a row, but the 2022 and 2023 hauls is as good as we've seen at this position in decades. I even grade it out higher than the 2006-07 hauls that were the previous standard for cornerback recruiting.
Morrison became an immediate star at Notre Dame, but he wasn't a surprise to IB, as the Arizona native earned a Top 100 grade and a 5.0-star upside grade on the IB board. Since it would look like I am speaking about how well he played this season, here's a quote from the IB evaluation of him when he signed:
""Morrison is a very smooth and impressively fluid athlete. He possesses impressive foot quickness, fluid hips and his transitions are clean and quick. Morrison can change direction with ease, both when asked to plant and drive downhill and when asked to open up and run. His ability to quickly flip his hips, both with the initial stem and when handling double moves down the field is outstanding.""
"".... Morrison is the ideal Notre Dame cornerback. He's long, he can play man coverage at a high level and he's physical on the perimeter as both a run defender and against the screen game. As I mentioned above, Morrison has all the tools to be a strong boundary cornerback, where he can be a legit one-on-one player.""
This is what I wrote about the 2022 cornerback grade:
""If I'm right about Morrison this is an A class, if I'm wrong about Morrison this is more of a B to B+ class.""
The point of this is to show that the grade above is based on what we saw from Morrison coming out of high school, as well as our grades for Bell and Gray, who earned Top 100 grades, and Mickey, who earned a Top 150 grade. This is an outstanding haul of cornerbacks, as good as anyone in the country. This is no a retroactive grade based on how brilliant Morrison was as a true freshman.
Grade: B-Signees (3): Brandyn Hillman (2023), Ben Minich (2023), Adon Shuler (2023)
This is the group that drags the grade down a bit. Notre Dame completely struck out on safeties in the 2022 class, and it ended up moving Jayden Bellamy there last fall, but Bellamy isn't included here because he has already left the program, so the Irish are back to having zero safeties in the 2022 class. I like the talent of the 2023 class, but it lacks the immediate impact player that it needed to have in order to overcome the depth issues that already exist on the roster.
That doesn't mean Shuler and Minich can't help as freshmen, but both would likely ideally need a year to get acclimated and build up their bodies before being thrust into prominent roles. They might not get that chance due to how limited the current depth chart is.
Having said that, the 2023 class by itself, taking needs out of the grade, was quite good. Hillman is a long, dynamic athlete that has a lot to learn about the position, but his tools are outstanding. I could see him playing deep at safety, or perhaps developing into a 3-3-5 type of safety that plays sort of a rover role. Shuler could do that as well, but I love the idea of him playing the alleys. Minich can do a little bit of everything, and he's one of the headiest players in the class, but don't let that fool you, he's athletic as well.
It's a good group, but the numbers issues and lack of top level talent drags the grade down.
Grade: B+
The floor vs ceiling aspect of the defensive line and the depth issues at safety are what keep this grade from being in the A range. Notre Dame recruited linebacker and cornerback as well as any program in the country the last two years, and the upside of the defensive line class is such that if just 3-4 of those guys hit the front will be outstanding. Safety needs to be addressed better in 2024, but the 2023 class helped salvage things by adding three really good football players. Notre Dame is closing the gap on defense, there's no doubt about that.

https://www.si.com/college/notredame/recruiting/notre-dame-football-recruiting-two-year-grades-offense-2022-2023,Notre Dame Recruiting Two-Year Grades - Offense Edition,"Grading the Notre Dame recruiting efforts on offense over the last two years
One of the best ways to evaluate a team's recruiting efforts is to look at how it stacked classes on top of each other. It gives far more context to how a team is building its roster, and the Notre Dame offense has used the two-year haul of the 2022 and 2023 classes to give the roster a major boost.
Position grades for the class are based on the player grades coming out of high school, not based on what the previous class has done, or not done, in college. Grades are based on how well Notre Dame met its needs, the talent of the group and fit.
Here are the two-year grades for the Notre Dame offense:
Grade: B+Signees (2): Steve Angeli (2022), Kenny Minchey (2023)
Landing Minchey played a big role in Notre Dame improving the future of its quarterback position. If you look at things from a three-year view, the 2020-22 classes were Drew Pyne, Tyler Buchner and Steve Angeli. That's one impact quarterback and two solid game manager types. When looking at the three year view of Buchner, Angeli and Minchey you see two impact players and a game manager. That's how you properly build a quarterback depth chart.
Minchey is one of the best quarterbacks in the 2023 class and he's a great fit for the Tommy Rees offense. He's smart, he has a great feel for the game, he is accurate and he throws a good deep ball. Minchey also has the ability to make plays outside the framework of the offense, especially as a passer. He has the frame, football intelligence and arm talent to player early in his career if the need arises.
Angeli is a solid all-around prospect. He has a quick release, possesses impressive leadership traits and he shows good game manager skills.
Grade: ASignees (3): Gi'Bran Payne (2022), Jadarian Price (2022), Jeremiyah Love (2023)
Notre Dame has done a great job restocking the running back depth chart in recent seasons, and landing Love in the 2023 class made it four straight seasons the Irish loaded up with big time prep prospects. Price and Love both graded out as Top 100 recruits on the IB board.
Price and Love are both home run hitters that also bring every down back tools to the game. Price is a bit more of a vertical runner while Love possesses impressive make-you-miss skills. Both are impact players in the pass game, and there is no doubt that Notre Dame can use them together as part of a rotation or on the field at the same time in its 21 personnel packages.
Payne graded out as a four-star recruit as well despite missing much of his final two seasons with injuries. If he is able to get back to full health this backfield will be as deep as its been in decades. There aren't many teams in college football that have recruited the running back position as well as Notre Dame has the last two seasons.
Grade: B+Signees (5): Tobias Merriweather (2022), Rico Flores Jr. (2023), Jaden Greathouse (2023), Braylon James (2023), Kaleb Smith (2023)
This grade gets dragged down because of numbers. Notre Dame hit their numbers mark in 2023 but the 2022 class was two players short. That means over a two-year span the Irish didn't land a full two-deep.
That's the negative, the positive is that the talent Notre Dame did land is outstanding. Merriweather was my top-ranked offensive recruit and a Top 50 overall national player on the IB Board with the 2022 class. He's long and fast, possessing the tools to be a dominant pass catcher at the next level. 
Notre Dame's 2023 class added a deep group of talented wideouts, and a group that brings a variety of skills. That diverse set of skills was incredibly needed. James brings home run speed, Greathouse brings an advanced game with the tools to be a volume pass catcher, Smith is fast and has impressive after-the-catch skills, and Flores is one of the most advanced route runners in the class.
If this group comes close to its full potential the Irish will have one of the better group of pass catchers in all of college football.
Grade: ASignees (3): Eli Raridon (2022), Holden Staes (2022), Cooper Flanagan (2023)
As expected, Notre Dame has recruited tight end as well as any program in the country over the last two years. Raridon graded out as a Top 100 recruit on the IB board and both Staes and Flanagan are Top 200 caliber prospects, but both have high ceilings and the potential to be outstanding college tight ends.
Raridon's injury history is problematic but he possesses all the tools to be an elite college tight end. He's long, fast, has great ball skills and as a senior he showed much-improved blocking ability. Staes is a great complement to Raridon in that he can do a lot of the detached aspects of the game. His game is quite raw but his combination of athleticism, ball skills and length make him a potential impact player in the pass game. 
Flanagan has a lot of throwback in him. He can do damage in the pass game, but right now his strength is as a dominant run blocker. That makes him a great complement to the 2022 tight ends, who are first pass catchers, although Raridon also shows strong blocking potential.
Grade: A-Signees (9): Ty Chan (2022), Ashton Craig (2022), Billy Schrauth (2022), Aamil Wagner (2022), Sullivan Absher (2023), Charles Jagusah (2023), Joe Otting (2023), Sam Pendleton (2023), Christopher Terek (2023)
There is a lot to like about the two offensive line hauls in 2022 and 2023. The 2022 group added a lot of athleticism to the roster, while the 2023 group added a lot of size and physicality. Notre Dame met its numbers needs in these two hauls, there is good top of the board talent, and there is a lot of impressive upside. The one question mark about this group, the thing that keeps it from being an A, is my question about whether or not it has the necessary tackle depth.
Wagner and Jagusah both have the tools to be left tackles in college, with Wagner possessing elite length and athleticism and Jagusah possessing massive size and elite power. The question mark with Wagner is can he add enough mass to his frame to handle the rigors of college football while maintaining his athleticism. Jagusah's left tackle question comes more from whether or not another position might be better for him. If this left tackle question gets answered favorably this group will be outstanding.
Jagusah and Schrauth are both top talents and both graded out as Top 100 recruits. There isn't a ton of star power in this group, but Wagner has elite upside, and if he hits his mark it will give the Irish the star power it needs to be a dominant line, should that line be made up of the players from these two classes. What makes it such a great haul isn't the star power, however, it's the depth of really good football players. There's only one lineman in this 9-man haul to earn below a 4.5-star upside grade, which is really impressive. It has a combination of size, power, athleticism and upside. It just needs to answer the tackle question.
2022 signee Joey Tanona is not listed in this group due to his career already being ended due to a tragic accident.
Grade: A-
Notre Dame needed a strong two-year haul on offense and it got that. The Irish landed at least one potential impact player at every position, and at every position but quarterback it added multiple players at each position with impact upside. Notre Dame's staff was able to largely overcome numbers issues with the 2023 class, and the skill talent that is heading to South Bend out of these two classes is as good as we've seen in back-to-back classes in a very, very long time.
There is no question that Notre Dame is closing the gap with these two offensive classes.
A — Elite / College Football Playoff caliberB — Outstanding / Top 15 caliberC — Solid / Borderline Top 25 caliberD — Subpar / Not good enoughF — Disaster

https://www.si.com/college/notredame/recruiting/notre-dame-football-answered-some-wide-receiver-question-marks-on-signing-day,Notre Dame Answered Some Wide Receiver Question Marks On Signing Day,"Under WR Coach Chansi Stuckey, Notre Dame answered a lot of wide receiver questions on National Signing Day
The coaching rise of Notre Dame wide receiver coach Chansi Stuckey has been a fascinating one to keep tabs on. When first hearing that Stuckey was a candidate at Notre Dame there was a sudden moment of, “Wait, that Chansi Stuckey? I didn’t know he coached!”
Truthfully, you can’t really blame anyone for that reaction. After previous stops as a graduate system and an offensive player development position, which was a non-coaching position while with the Clemson program, Stuckey landed as the wide receiver coach at Baylor during the 2021 season.
The former Clemson star and NFL wideout would spend just that one season with the Bears, and wouldn’t have the opportunity to see his first recruiting class all the way through when Notre Dame came calling. So when Marcus Freeman made Stuckey a new member of the staff, his experience was the major talking point from Notre Dame fans and those who follow the program closely. 
Did that mean he couldn’t recruit? No, of course not but you also had no reason to believe that he could. The 2023 recruiting class, his first with the Irish program, was a litmus test of sorts to see what exactly Stuckey was as a recruiter. 
On a staff of proven recruiters, who have done it at an extremely high level historically, Stuckey had a lot to prove. To say he passed with flying colors would be a massive understatement. 
Stuckey used his Texas ties while with the Baylor program to his advantage early on. He had previous relationships with some extremely talented pass catchers from the state and quickly rekindled those connections.
Among the biggest early targets was Round Rock (Texas) Stony Point standout Braylon James, who was previously at Del Valle High School before he transferred back to Stony Point for his senior year. James had high interest in Notre Dame even while the previous staff was in place but had failed to get a phone call returned after a couple of attempts. 
James didn’t have to wait long to hear from Stuckey and this new staff. At 6-3 and 185 pounds with 4.47 verified speed, James is the type of freak pass catcher that Notre Dame needs to keep loading up on. If developed properly, he should be an absolute nightmare for opposing defenses on the next level. 
Arguably one of the more accomplished pass catchers in the 2023 class nationally, Austin (Texas) Westlake star Jaden Greathouse was on the board for Notre Dame upon Stuckey’s arrival. Before he came to South Bend, however, it was nothing more than a pipe dream for the Irish. There was zero traction up until that point.
That quickly changed with Stuckey, who Greathouse named consistently as one of the biggest factors in his recruitment. Greathouse is a much different athlete than James, which is an outstanding potential pairing. 
At 6-2 and 210 pounds, Greathouse is about as physical of a pass catcher as you will find nationally. He plays big boy football and clearly believes that every football in the air is only his to come down with. The Texas native is also a very nuanced pass catcher who brings some of the cleanest route running that you will find. 
Balance is the underrated part of this wide receiver group for Notre Dame. One position type that they have needed more of in recent years is true slot types who can impact the game after the catch. 
Stuckey and the Notre Dame staff found that player in Frisco (Texas) Reedy wide receiver Kaleb Smith, who was previously committed to Texas Tech. The Irish were able to make that flip and secure arguably one of the most underrated pass catchers in the class.
Whether it is as a wide receiver or return man, Smith is an impressive player in space, possessing the short area quickness and explosiveness to make things happen after the catch. He is another testament to a staff evaluating and identifying talent that could fit well together. 
All three Texas pass catchers are extremely different, and that’s exactly what makes the fit so interesting. 
For the final member of a potentially dynamic four-man class, Folsom (Calif.) High School star Rico Flores Jr. was a player who was previously on the board when Stuckey came to Notre Dame. A bit of a common theme, Flores has been fully transparent that there wasn’t a ton of interest from his side when the previous staff was still in charge. 
It is no exaggeration to say that if a coaching change didn’t happen that the California star would not be a part of the class right now. Just ask Flores for that confirmation. 
Flores is an intriguing pass catcher who is one of the more polished wide receivers in the 2023 recruiting class. He has an outside and in profile that could potentially provide snaps out wide or in the slot in a pinch. 
The Folsom star is an impressive ball tracker who attacks the ball well working vertically. He is also a mature route runner who can create some instant separation in the short to intermediate levels of the field. Flores provides an overall tremendous compliment to the other receivers in the class potentially. 
It’s hard to poke many holes in the 2023 wide receiver group as a whole. In a world ruled by NIL, Stuckey was able to identify good fits into the class and close quickly.
With the position having opportunities out there heading into next season, the class should have an opportunity to fight for immediate playing time. 
In a world where the transfer portal is such a prevalent commodity to roster construction, recruiting has transcended way past just high schoolers. With depth inherited death issues still on the roster from the previous staff, Notre Dame was also in the market for a transfer portal addition to the wide receiver room. 
Quietly the staff also pulled in a really nice addition on Wednesday amidst the signing day madness. Former Virginia Tech pass catcher Kaleb Smith went public that he had committed to finish out his college career as a part of the Irish program. 
In 11 games in 2022 for the Hokies, Smith led the team with 37 receptions for 674 yards and three touchdowns for a struggling passing attack.
At 6-2 and 222 pounds, Smith brings an obvious big body to the table and he uses every bit of that frame to win above the rim and extend for the football. He has premier body control to contort his body in a variety of ways and finish through contact. 
Smith also has some sneaky vertical speed, evident by 18.2 yards per reception last season. There is a clear projection as a productive outside receiver if Smith makes a clean transition from Blacksburg. 
The even better part about the fit is that Notre Dame isn’t hurting for wide receiver talent. It isn’t a necessity for Smith to come in and be “the guy.” 
If he does, that’s great. If he just becomes good depth, that’s also great. With his size, experience and special teams ability, he is an outstanding addition to the Notre Dame roster.

https://www.si.com/college/notredame/football/notre-dame-football-braden-fiske-is-a-must-get-in-the-transfer-portal,Braden Fiske Is A Must Get For Notre Dame,"Notre Dame is battling for Western Michigan transfer Braden Fiske, and landing him is a key to the Irish having a championship caliber defense in 2023
Notre Dame has not been a major transfer portal player but when they do it is for a major need, and that is true looking at the 2023 season as well. Notre Dame has made Western Michigan transfer defensive tackle Braden Fiske a priority, and landing him will play a key role in the Irish building a championship defense, and missing on him would be a big loss. 
We saw how important Harvard transfer Chris Smith was to the 2022 defensive rotation, and Fiske brings a much more impactful skill set to the table. At this point the Irish are among his final three schools along with USC and Florida State.
There are a number of reasons why Fiske is so important to the Irish in 2023.
1. SIZE UPGRADE - While I think the constant emphasis on ""getting bigger"" that I see in many fan discussions gets overblown a bit I do believe that Notre Dame can and should get bigger up front. This is especially true if the Irish want to play more three-man fronts. Listed at 6-5 and 300 pounds, Fiske would certainly add a size boost to the defense. When I first saw his size my thought was, ""He could play nose tackle, right?"" Fiske, however, is no a nose tackle, he's a three-technique to five-technique type of player, which adds even more to how his size profile would benefit the defense.
Last season, defensive end Rylie Mills was the biggest starting defensive lineman at 295 pounds, the next biggest player was Jayson Ademilola at 285 pounds and next was Howard Cross, who checks in just around 270-75 pounds. If Fiske were to pick Notre Dame he would become their biggest starter, which would bump Mills down a bit and would give the Irish a much-needed boost in size.
2. IMPACT TRAITS - Fiske isn't a big space eating interior player, part of what makes him such a potentially impactful player for the Irish defense is that he's productive. Fiske has racked up 102 tackles, 20 tackles for loss and 10 sacks the last two seasons. Yes, that's playing against MAC schools, but in four games against Power 5 opponents he racked up 3.5 tackles for loss, a sack and a forced fumble. 
If you project those numbers out over a 12-game season against Notre Dame caliber competition that would result in him posting 42 tackles, 10.5 tackles for loss and 3 sacks. When you consider he'll also be surrounded by better players it projects his numbers to be better than that, but even if he were to post those numbers it would be a major jump in disruptive production. 
Notre Dame's most productive interior defender was Jayson Ademilola, who had just 29 tackles, 6 tackles for loss and 3 sacks. Next was Howard Cross III with 33 tackles, 2.5 tackles for loss and 2 sacks.
Over the last two seasons Fiske has racked up 102 tackles, 20 tackles for loss and 10 sacks. No one on the Notre Dame defense came close to that over the same stretch.
3. VERSATILITY - Fiske can play a lot of spots in the Irish defense, and his ability to be disruptive is present at all of them. In a four-down front he projects best as a three-technique, which is the spot that was manned by Ademilola, whose Notre Dame career will be over after the bowl game. Landing Fiske would give the Irish a bigger, more disruptive player at that position in the base looks, which would be significant.
Fiske was forced to play big end for the Broncos when they faced Michigan State, and he stepped up and played well. He had 5 tackles, a tackle for loss and a forced fumble in that contest. While that isn't his best position, he could certainly play there in a pinch in the four-down looks.
Notre Dame didn't run much three-down this year for a number of reasons, but I do believe the staff would like to do it more, and Fiske would allow that to become a more impactful look. In a three-man look he would give the Irish a pair of 295+ pound ends, along with Mills, that can be physical against the run and disruptive against the pass game. Fiske and Mills could form quite the potent duo in this kind of look.
With players like Jordan Botelho, Junior Tuihalamaka and Josh Burnham battling for spots at the Vyper, a 3-3 look could be far more advantageous than it was the last two seasons with Isaiah Foskey at the position. Foskey is a pure defensive end, but all three of the aforementioned players are converted linebackers, so having them at the Vyper with Fiske and Mills on the field together means Notre Dame could do a lot more of the looks you want in a defense that moves between a 4-2-5 and a 3-3-5 without having to substitute personnel.
4. DEPTH UPGRADE - Notre Dame will likely be quite young behind the starters next season, so being able to add a veteran inside allows the younger players to have a bit more time to develop before they become ""the guys"" in the Irish defense.
5. LEADERSHIP - The future of the interior of the defensive line is likely current players like Gabriel Rubio, Jason Onye, Tyson Ford and Donovan Hinish, as well as freshmen Devan Houstan and possibly Brenan Vernon and Boubacar Traore. As stated above, all could use one more year before being forced into roles where they have to be ""the guy"" inside. Fiske will be a 6th year senior in 2023 and he was a captain for the Broncos. 
Having a player with his talent and experience would prove incredibly beneficial to those talented younger players. He not only gives them more time to grow and develop, he has the leadership and experience to also help make them better players. That means if Fiske comes to Notre Dame and embraces this role he could have an impact for the Irish that goes beyond the one season he would be in uniform.
That could be huge for Notre Dame.
Notre Dame director of recruiting Ryan Roberts did a quick film breakdown of Fiske as well.
A scheme versatile defensive lineman for Western Michigan over the last few seasons, Fiske has been asked to do everything from playing nose tackle and working all the way out to a five technique. This past year, he was even asked to play more of a nine technique as a standup rusher against Michigan State with injuries to other defensive ends on the roster, and did it with high success. That alignment versatility is a rare component that you do not see too often. 
Originally coming to the Broncos program as a slender 240-pound defensive lineman, Fiske has now grown to play between 290 and 300 pounds pretty consistently. Fiske has added good weight to his frame and his power profile has been a big beneficiary. He is able to play well inside his frame and generate a ton of power in some very tight windows. This allows him to anchor down soundly against double teams and work through contact.
Fiske’s best projection is in a one gap penetration style defense that allows him to shoot gaps and create penetration. He has a good combination of short area quickness and first step explosiveness to put opposing offensive lineman in some very difficult positions with a tough time to recover. For a player who fits best inside ideally, Fiske is surprisingly solid in space. This allows him to play outside his frame and finish a variety of plays.

https://www.si.com/college/notredame/football/notre-dame-football-marcus-freeman-talks-nil-impact-on-irish-recruiting-stires,Marcus Freeman Talks NIL And Its Impact On Recruiting At Notre Dame,"Name, image and likeness money played a big part though in other Notre Dame de-commitments. Irish head coach Marcus Freeman discussed it in detail
The dust is settling from what turned out to be one of the more tumultuous signing days in recent memory. When all was said and done Marcus Freeman and Co inked a 24-member class that included 21 four-star football players. The 3.875 star average the group totaled is the second-highest at Notre Dame since 2002 (the Jaylon Smith-led 2013 class averaged 3.913). 
The majority of Freeman’s first full-fledged recruiting class committed to Notre Dame before the 2022 season ever began.  
""It’s important,” Freeman said of the early commitments. ""I think it’s a lot harder to de-commit than it is to commit. We’ve always said that the earlier you can get these guys committed to Notre Dame, I think the better chance you have to signing them. But you’ve got to make sure they understand the value of this place and with time comes other obstacles, right. Other thoughts into these recruits minds and thought process. For them to continue to formulate a bond with each other within this class is so important, because that's ultimately I think one of the most important factors into this decision is the bond they have with the other guys in their class, because that’s never going to change.  
The recent tumult did not come from the 24 commitments, though. The drama came from the ones who de-committed and went elsewhere. Defensive end Keon Keeley, safety Peyton Bowen, quarterback Dante Moore, offensive tackle Elijah Paige, cornerback Justyn Rhett and running back Jayden Limar were all committed to Notre Dame at one point, but they all ended up at different schools.  
""Listen, we’re all competitors,” Freeman said when asked about the disappointment of losing highly rated recruits in the class. ""We want everyone. If we could take 30 kids, 40 kids I’m sure we would, but at the end of the day you have to continue to sell what you believe attracts young people here. They have to make the decision to come to Notre Dame for the right reasons and if it’s not the best place for them we have to be okay with that and really make sure we’re just bringing in the right kids. You can’t worry about the ones you didn’t get. More so, you have to be concerned about the ones that you are bringing in. At the end of the day that’s what’s important. I felt like we brought in the exact guys we needed and we’re extremely happy with this class.” 
This is the second recruiting cycle in which name, image and likeness (NIL) was at play in the recruiting process. Limar chose Oregon. Moore, who de-committed of his silent verbal, first flipped to Oregon then ultimately signed with UCLA. 
Keeley, the crowned jewel of the class, was also an early commit who de-committed in August, ended up at Alabama.  The biggest commotion in the last week came from the ""will he or won’t he stay committed” turned de-commitment from five-star safety Bowen.
The lure of instant NIL cash is believed to have been a major factor in the flips of all four of the talented players.  
""If that’s the only reason they want to come to Notre Dame this ain’t going to be the right fit for them,” Freeman said of the impact of NIL money on recruits. ""I think the more we can get them back to show them what makes Notre Dame important, what makes this place special, the value of this university, the value of this education, the value of playing football here at this place is really what attracts you and what keeps you here. That’s what we all have to understand.  
""If you’re coming here because of NIL, it’s probably not going to be the best place for you and it’s not going to be the place you choose,” Freeman continued. ""If you come here and you understand the value of this university, this network, this football team, then you’ve got a great chance to stick it out when things get really, really tough. Because that’s college. That’s, 18 to 22 it gets tough. There’s bumps in the road and when you choose this place for what it brings you way past the time you’re here, then during those tough times you’ll lean on those teammates that I just talked about, those guys that came in with you, but also you’ll lean on the understanding that hey, the value of Notre Dame is going to take care of you for a long time.  
It’s not enough just to simply evaluate the talent of a player. Freeman and his staff must also now gauge a potential recruit to determine during the recruiting process just how much NIL could be a factor in their college decision. 
""I think every kid you’ve got to look at and say, okay, why did we get him or why didn’t we get him,” Freeman remarked. ""That’s something we’ll do as a staff is say, okay, every recruit that signed here, why did we get him, what was important? The kids that we didn’t get, why didn’t we get him, what was important, what could we have done differently? The ones that de-committed, why did they de-commit, what could we have done differently? And some of them we might have to say, it wasn’t the right fit, it’s okay. Some we’ve got to look and say we’ve got to evaluate the way we’re recruiting, what we’re selling, how we got to the point where they didn’t want to come here or they de-committed.  
""I think if you don’t learn from every kid that’s committed or de-committed, you’re losing a chance to grow and that’s something we’re going to do,” Freeman continued. ""Will NIL be a topic? Absolutely. We have to make sure that no matter what the important things in recruiting, we’ve got to make sure that we’re competitive and NIL is important to some of these recruits and we’ve got to make sure we’re competitive and I think we are. But we’ve got to continue to look back and evaluate who we got, why we got them and why we didn’t get certain guys.” 
The cold hard facts of recruiting in an NIL world is money talks. That means some player will require an up-front dollar amount to sign a letter of intent on the dotted line. 
""We don’t speak to that,” said Freeman. ""Is it a part of recruiting? Yeah, because you discuss it. It’s a topic of discussion. But in terms of acquisition feeds, we’re not going to get into that. We can’t. Because, again, if that’s going to be the reason that you decided to come here, man, it’s hard to keep you here. That’s what I think we all, as coaches and competitors that want who we view sometimes as the best, right, we want the best, we want the highest rated, all these different things, we have to understand it’s still about getting the right guys here. You look at last year’s class, and again that was another top 10 class, I think I looked at it the other day maybe four or five guys played this year, didn’t redshirt. I mean, out of a class that we signed 22 to 25 guys. So, I say that’s important, because if you’re coming here for an acquisition fee, as you said, or you’re coming here for NIL and you don’t get that instant gratification of playing right away, it’s going to be tough, right? Tough to stay here. That’s what we’ve got to understand is when you bring these guys in it’s going to take a little bit of time to really be able to run out there at Notre Dame Stadium and have a huge impact on our program. It takes time. Very few guys can come in here and play and start right away.  
""Ben Morrison, listen, I don’t know how highly rated he was the only guy in that freshman class to start this year,” Freeman continued. ""We’ve had a couple guys that played, but the majority of guys redshirted. Highly recruited guys, highly rated guys. But they’ve decided to stay and say, hey I’ve got to develop, I’ve got to continue to commit to a program and this team and my development. Those are the guys we need, because as you look back two years ago, a lot of those guys, the Blake Fishers, Joe Alts and some of those guys, those are the ones that are playing a lot of ball for you now. It takes time to really make that adjustment from playing high school to playing major college football. So we need guys that understand the value of this place and what it will provide in the long run, because you’re not just going to get that instant gratification that some guys are looking for.”

https://www.si.com/college/notredame/recruiting/notre-dame-football-2023-recruiting-class-grades-defense-edition,Notre Dame 2023 Recruiting Class Grades - Defense Edition,"Handing out position-by-position grades for the Notre Dame 2023 defensive recruiting class
Building a championship roster requires stacking strong groups on top of each other. Notre Dame landed an outstanding defensive line class in 2022, and it needed to land another one in 2023. While much of the focus will be on what was lost, what Notre Dame landed was still quite good.
Let's hand out grades, which consist of meeting needs from a numbers/depth standpoint, talent of the signees and fit into the system and culture.
Grade: BSignees: Devan Houstan, Armel Mukam, Boubacar Traore, Brenan Vernon
Notre Dame needed a four-man class in 2023 and they got that group. Notre Dame needed to add length and size to the depth chart, and it met those needs. Notre Dame also needed to add impact talent, and that's the part that drags the class down a bit.
It's a good group, a group a lot of teams would want, but it's not an elite group as it currently stands. I'm not as concerned about not landing an edge rusher due to what Notre Dame has from last year's class, but there is a lot of boom or bust talent in the class. If some of the high upside players pan out this grade jumps up, but there's also a chance it drops of they play closer to their floors.
This is a versatile group of players with a lot of length and tools. Brenan Vernon was in the class a very long time, and where he ends up will be interesting. More of a big end when he committed, Vernon has filled out quite a bit and could project as an interior guy in college. If he can stay healthy the Ohio native could be a standout for the Irish. Traore has exceptional tools, but he's quite raw. Mukam's ceiling is also very high, but he too is quite raw.
I'd argue the highest floor in the class is Houstan, whose game I really like. He could play anywhere from 5-tech to nose tackle. Houstan is longer than recent interior players, which is a need, and I see him growing into a disruptive playmaker up the middle.
Grade: ASignees: Jaiden Ausberry, Drayk Bowen, Preston Zinter
For the second straight year Notre Dame has landed one of the best linebacker hauls in the country. The rankings drop that Ausberry and Bowen had after they committed to Notre Dame is one of the many examples of why the national rankings are flawed and relatively useless to use as a driver for evaluating this class. Both were Top 50 caliber players when they picked Notre Dame and both were even better as seniors than they were as juniors.
Bowen had a monster senior season and he projects at both Mike and Will, and it wouldn't shock me if he played some on the edge as well. Bowen can run and hit, and he's a leader of this class. Ausberry can also run and hit, and he's a smooth linebacker with an incredibly high football IQ.
I've talked to sources that believe Zinter might have the highest ceiling in the class. That's not how I grade it, but it speaks to how good this group is. If I had a knock on this class it would be that I don't see it playing as well as a three man group (Rover, Mike, Will) as last year's haul, but with Bowen and Zinter both having tools to play Vyper in some looks this group can get on the field together.
Depth needs met? Check. Upgrade in athleticism? Check. Impact potential? Check. Versatility? Check. I love this linebacker haul.
Grade: ASignees: Micah Bell, Christian Gray
Notre Dame landed an A grade at cornerback for the second straight year, and Mike Mickens has quickly and completely overhauled his position. Very few teams in the country, if any, have out-recruited Notre Dame at cornerback in the last two years.
Gray is a long and smooth playmaker at cornerback with outstanding speed and athleticism. The St. Louis native has the tools to be an impactful boundary corner, but he also has the length and range to play the field spot in a manner that looks a lot like how Cam Hart plays it. Bell is a dynamic athlete and is arguably the fastest cornerback in the country. His game is a bit raw but his tools are outstanding beyond just his speed.
Gray and Bell could easily be on the field together, and they are both ideal scheme fits for the Notre Dame defense. Whether it's Marcus Freeman or Al Golden running it, the Irish defense wants to play a lot more man coverage, and that fits both Gray and Bell. It's hard to land pure cover players in today's era, and Notre Dame landed two of the better pure cover players in the country in 2023.
Grade: BSignees: Brandyn Hillman, Ben Minich, Adon Shuler
Notre Dame missed out on a chance for an elite safety haul, and that is something that will always be part of the narrative. But with Peyton Bowen out of the class you should now view Hillman as a safety, and that changes the narrative a bit for me.
Notre Dame needed to land three safeties in the class, and talking to sources the plan was always to have Hillman be a guy that could play safety if they lost Bowen. If they landed Bowen then Hillman could project at safety still, or you could use him at other spots. But landing him late was big for the Irish in many ways, and it gave them protection in case Bowen did what he ultimately did.
This isn't a group with the high end talent, at least not from a current grade standpoint, but it's a quality group nonetheless. All three are four-star prospects on the Irish Breakdown board, all have room to get better and they fit well together. Minich has the range to play the alleys and centerfield, Shuler can be an alley guy or even a rover in a true 4-2-5, and Hillman can do that as well. This group can play together, and that's key.
It's an athletic group, it's a highly productive group and although it will be a unit that fans constantly say ""what if,"" there's no denying the Irish staff improved the position by landing this group of defenders.
Grade: B+
I battled back and forth between B+ and A- but I'm going to go with B+ because of the questions I have about the floor vs ceiling gap along the defensive line. This is a very, very good group of defensive players. Notre Dame met needs, it landed potential impact players on all three levels and it continues to recruit the cornerback position at an elite level. If you're able to focus on what is and not what could have been it's hard not to really like this group.

https://www.si.com/college/notredame/recruiting/notre-dame-football-2023-recruiting-class-grades-offense-edition,Notre Dame 2023 Recruiting Class Grades - Offense Edition,"Handing out position-by-position grades for the Notre Dame 2023 offensive recruiting class
Notre Dame has wrapped up its 2023 recruiting class by landing an outstanding group of offensive recruits. It was a bit of a winding road for the Notre Dame offensive coaches, but once the current group was put together it hit the ground running and earned a lot of impressive wins.
Notre Dame needed a great year on this side of the ball and got it. Let's hand out grades, which consist of meeting needs from a numbers/depth standpoint, talent of the signees and fit into the system and culture.
Grade: A-Signee: Kenny Minchey
This was an incredibly wild ride, but in the end I think Notre Dame not only landed one of the best quarterbacks in the class, they landed a kid who is a perfect fit for the program. During the summer while he was still committed to Pitt I ranked Minchey as the No. 81 overall player in the country and as the No. 7 overall quarterback in a loaded quarterback class. Notre Dame needed to land a Top 10 quarterback in this class and they got one.
Minchey also fits what OC Tommy Rees wants quite nicely. Minchey earns rave reviews from everyone that engages with him in a football context for his football IQ. He's one of the smartest quarterbacks in the class and shows the ability to absorb a lot of offense, that's important for Notre Dame. That intelligence plays itself out on the field, where Minchey plays with great anticipation and decision making. He has a fast, compact release, he shows excellent ball placement and touch, and he can get the ball out with velocity and can attack defenses over the top.
He's mobile, but his mobility is primarily used to buy time as a passer. When he does run he can be a chain mover that can run some read zone concepts to pull it and get out the backside, but he'll be better suited on RPOs than read zones. All he is really missing to be the ideal passer is a couple of more inches of height, and his grade also comes down a tad because he missed half of his senior season.
Grade: A-Signee: Jeremiyah Love
Notre Dame only needed one running back in this class, but it wanted two, and the fact it didn't get what it wanted is why this grade dropped down to an A-. If we're talking about what they needed, and the talent they landed, it's hard to argue with where things ended up. After landing two very good backs in 2021 (Logan Diggs, Audric Estime) and an incredibly talented back in 2022 (Jadarian Price), Notre Dame needed a big time player in the 2023 class and they got one with Love.
Notre Dame got on Love relatively early, and when they landed him he was a dynamic athlete that was a bit raw and tools as a player, but his game needed a lot of technical work. As a senior, Love really broke out and played dominant football. His vision and feel for the game took a huge leap, he was thicker and ran with more authority, and he did all that while maintaining his home run skills.
Love looked natural as a runner as a senior and his game took off, but he's also a major weapon in the pass game. He fits the Notre Dame offense quite well, and he showed he's a money player. In 8 career playoff games, Love rushed for 1,022 yards and 17 touchdowns on just 92 carries (11.1 YPC).
Grade: ASignees: Rico Flores Jr., Jaden Greathouse, Braylon James, Kaleb Smith
It's hard to imagine the 2023 recruiting cycle ending up much better for Notre Dame than this four man haul, which will be able to stand up against any receiving class in the country. Notre Dame hit an A grade for need, fit and talent with this four-man haul.
Notre Dame has a long home run hitter in James, a dominant high volume pass catcher in Greathouse, one of the best route runners in the country in Flores and they landed a player in Smith that brings much-needed shiftiness and big play potential with the ball. Not one of these players is pigeonholed into one position either, as both can line up in at least two positions in the Notre Dame offense.
Beyond numbers needs, Notre Dame needed to add more big play ability and it needed to add more size to the roster. It also needed at least two players that can come in and play right away, and the grades for each of those categories is high as well. James and Smith both have electronic 40-yard dash times in the 4.4 range, and both show home run ability while playing in Texas. Greathouse is one of the most ready to play wideouts in the country, and Flores should have a chance to play early as well thanks to his polish, feel for the game and hands.
This group erases many of the roster issues that were created by the predecessor to Chansi Stuckey, and it was a grand slam home run for the first year receivers coach.
Grade: B+Signee: Cooper Flanagan
Notre Dame only needed one tight end in the class and it needed a tight end that was more traditional in his style of play. Landing Flanagan checked both of those boxes. He is a bit of a throwback tight end thanks to his impressive size (6-5, 240) and his ability to line up attached to the line and to dominate as a run blocker.
Flanagan is a quality athlete and pass catcher as well, so he's far from being just a physical one trick pony. He will do a lot of work from a traditional tight end alignment, but he has a chance to be a pass game weapon as well. Flanagan nicely complements the one-two punch of Eli Raridon and Holden Staes that Notre Dame signed in the 2022 class.
Notre Dame could use a player like Flanagan in the lineup next season, so the Irish get a bit of a bump up in grade here to a B+ because they landed a player with the tools to come in and compete for an immediate role.
Grade: A-Signee: Sullivan Absher, Charles Jagusah, Joe Otting, Sam Pendleton, Christopher Terek
Notre Dame hit all the marks needed in this class. The Irish needed four offensive linemen in this class, but the staff wanted five. It met that need. Notre Dame needed to add some players that could compete in the interior, and it met that need. Notre Dame needed a left tackle in the class, and it got one of the best in the country. It needed two players who could play tackle, and it got that.
Jagusah is a five-star recruit that showed as a senior that he could play left tackle of the need arises. He could also easily step into the right tackle spot or a guard spot and be just as dominant. The potential he flashed as a junior turned into consistent production as a senior, and his grade took off. Jagusah always had a five-star upside grade, but that upside became reality this season. Having a player of his talent anchor this class is a big part of the reason it earned an A- grade beyond the depth needs.
Pendleton, Terek and Otting are all tackles in high school but project as interior players. Pendleton is a sound player that brings brute force to the game, Otting is an athletic player with a very high ceiling and Terek is a grinder. The key to this class, and what will ultimately determine if it lives up to its grade is Absher. He's very, very toolsy but comes from an option offense and he has a big transition to make. If he pans out, either as a right tackle or dominant guard, this class will be big time.
The Irish also needed an infusion in brute force, and honestly that might be the best part of this class. All five players, including the undersized Otting, are physically dominant players that punish defenders on the regular.
Grade: A-
There are a couple of areas where a talent upgrade could be had, but overall this is a very balanced, talented and deep offensive class. It landed one of the best quarterbacks in the country, it landed five impact skill players, it landed speed, it landed size, it met its needs for players that can help early on and of course at the foundation is a big, deep and physical offensive line class.
Any criticisms with this class would be around the degree of the talent, and we're arguing about whether it should be an A, A- or B+. That's a great place to be, and it was an absolute must to land this type of class after what happened at the end of the 2022 cycle and after the 2020 and 2021 classes had so many injuries and departures.

Notre Dame has officially landed Christopher Terek, one of the more physically opposing offensive lineman in the Midwest.

Terek is a tackle for Glenbard West and he has a tackle frame, which is often what Harry Hiestand has focused on in the past. What Hiestand has done is take tackle bodies and then move some inside, and Terek fits that mold from a physical standpoint. His game is certainly suited for the interior of the offensive line. Terek is a powerful short-area player that thrives with the physical part of the game. His game should take a jump with a move inside, where he can handle the run game and he should be even a better fit in pass protection inside. Notre Dame also looked to add players with a more physical demeanor in this class, and Terek fits that mold as well.
Ryan Roberts, Director of Recruiting: “Terek is the ideal offensive guard on the next level, with the ability to also give you some snaps at offensive tackle in a pinch. He plays with tremendous physicality and effort as a blocker. Once he is able to establish inside positioning, it's over.”
John Garcia Jr.: ""Bookend tackle frame with college-ready build and experience in modern scheme. Wide pass stance with extension and enough driving ability to work gap or pass-off plays without wasted movement. Good athlete comfortable re-routing in short spaces with reach blocking range off the snap. Encouraging leverage off the ball relative to height despite somewhat raw technical ability while working in the wash. Best football is well ahead.""
Glenbard West Head Coach Chad Hetlet: “Christopher plays the game the right way. He works hard and he plays hard. He is a tone setter in the run game. It was a true privilege to be able to coach him.”

Maddy Westbeld scored a season-high 23 points to lead the Notre Dame women’s basketball team to an 85-57 win over Western Michigan. The Fighting Irish (10-1) outscored the Broncos (5-6) 47-27 in the second half to overcome a lackluster first 20 minutes of play.  
Notre Dame started strong by hitting 9 of 15 shots (60%) in the first quarter. Kylee Watson hit all four of her field goal attempts to pace the Irish to a comfortable 20-12 lead, thanks in part to a defense that held Western Michigan to 4 of 13 (30%) shooting. Watson finished the game going 5 for 5 from the floor for 10 points in a little more than 19 minutes. 
The Broncos played the Irish to an 18-18 draw in the second quarter. Six Notre Dame turnovers helped keep Western within eight points at the intermission.  
Niele Ivey’s halftime speech to her team lit a much-needed fire to start the second half. The Irish defense forced nine straight misses from the field by the Broncos and ignited an offense that raced to a 17-0 run to put the game away. Western Michigan did not hit its first field goal of the second half until there was 3:02 remaining in the third quarter with Notre Dame on top 55-35.  
Westbeld was 10 for 16 from the field for her fourth consecutive double figure scoring game. She pulled down eight rebounds as well. Sonia Citron scored 16 points to run her consecutive double figure streak to 10 games. The only game she has not hit double digits was the season-opener against Northern Illinois.  
Olivia Miles scored eight points, marking the first time this season she has not scored in double figures. She dished out 12 assists with seven rebounds. 
The Irish have the next four days off for Christmas break. They will reconvene on campus next week to prepare for their Dec. 29 game at Miami.

https://www.si.com/college/notredame/football/notre-dame-football-lands-virginia-tech-transfer-wide-receiver-kaleb-smith-2023,Notre Dame Lands Virginia Tech Transfer Wide Receiver Kaleb Smith,"Notre Dame has dipped into the transfer portal and landed Virginia Tech transfer Kaleb Smith
Notre Dame has once again dipped into the transfer portal, this time landing former Virginia Tech wide receiver Kaleb Smith. The former Hokie signed with Notre Dame and will be part of the Irish team in the spring.
Smith was Virginia Tech's leading wide receiver during the 2022 season, hauling in career highs in receptions (37), yards (674) and touchdowns (3). His best performances were against NC State (3 catches, 141 yards), Pittsburgh (9 catches, 152 yards) and Georgia Tech (4 catches, 78 yards). 
Smith averaged an impressive 18.2 yards during the 2022 campaign, although his game projects as more of a possession receiver. The 6-2, 222-pound wideout played mostly in the boundary for the Hokies, but he also projects as a player that could get action in the slot in the Notre Dame offense.
Notre Dame is bringing in an outstanding four-man receiver haul in the 2023 class, and it returns talented players from the current roster (Tobias Merriweather, Deion Colzie, Lorenzo Styles, Jayden Thomas), but there was a need for depth and experience as well. Notre Dame will be quite young at wideout in 2023, and Smith brings with him a wealth of experience. He was also a team captain for the Hokes during the 2022 campaign. Smith can come in and provide the Irish with a lot of experience, but its his leadership that could provide the most value to the young but overall inexperienced Irish pass catchers.
The Louisa County native hauled in two passes for 19 yards against Notre Dame during the 2021 season. Notre Dame landed a grad transfer wide receiver in 2020 when it brought in Ben Skowronek, who went on to be a quality player for the Irish that season. The hope is that Smith can provide similar value, although snaps will be harder to come by with the 2023 wide receiver depth chart having a lot more depth and talent than the 2020 group.
