https://www.si.com/college/louisville/basketball/christmas-break-mentally-reflect,Louisville to Use Christmas Break to 'Mentally Reflect' and 'Reset',"With a nine-day break in between games, the Cardinals are using this time to refocus in the midst of a rough start to their season.
LOUISVILLE, Ky. - Saying it has been a rough first month-and-a-half for the Louisville men's basketball would be a bit of an understatement.
The Cardinals lost their first three games of the 2022-23 season all by single digits to mid-majors, then were blasted in their next six by an average of 25.2 points per game to drop their first nine games of the Kenny Payne era. It was the program's worst start to a season since the 1940-41 squad lost their first 11 games.
Louisville finally got off the schneid by winning against Western Kentucky and Florida A&M, but have lost their last two games, most recently a 76-64 defeat at NC State to fall to 2-11 and 0-3 in ACC play. With 18 games left in the regular season, the Cardinals are just nine losses away from matching their most in a single season. They went 12-20 in their 1997-98 campaign.
Fortunately, Louisville has reached a point in the season where they have some room to breathe. The Cardinals have reached the Christmas break portion of their schedule, and have a nine-day period in between games. The program fully plans on using this extended break to ""mentally reflect"" on the season up to this point.
""I just told the guys, look, I want them to go home and have a couple of days of spending with their families, enjoy the Christmas break,"" Payne said after their loss to the Wolfpack on Thursday night. ""But I also want them to think about what more they can do to bring more to the table. What more can they do, each individual, to help us get over the hump.
""I think they need this break, but I think they need it for a couple of reasons. Obviously, it's Christmas. Great time of the year. But also to mentally reflect on, ""what do I truly want? What do I truly want his team to be?"" The second half of this (season), it's coming fast, and we're gonna be playing some really good teams. So we have to be on point, we have to be 100 percent bought in, and go in there and fight for everything that we get.""
Payne isn't wrong. Their next time out will be on the road against in-state rival Kentucky, who ranks No. 19 in the AP Poll and No. 10 according to KenPom. After that, it's nothing but ACC competition. As of this writing, four ACC teams are ranked in the AP Top 25 - Virginia, Duke, Virginia Tech and Miami - with an additional six ranked inside the KenPom top-100.
For reference, KenPom currently has Louisville as the No. 256 team in Division I. Even with teams like Boston College and Georgia Tech still on the docket, KenPom does not have the Cardinals favored in a single game for the rest of the season.
Fortunately, the players seem to recognize that Chrismas break for them should not be entirely rest and relaxation. Sure, there will time for them to unwind and enjoy having extended time off, but they agree with Payne that they also need to use this time to ""reset"" their mindset when practice and games resume.
""While we're at home, we have to remember our obligation to our team,"" forward Brandon Huntley-Hatfield said. ""We can't just be sitting down, not working out, not staying in shape and things like that. When we come back, we have to be (in) a little bit more better shape, be a little bit better players in every aspect so we can go on a run.
""I feel like it's time to make a run right now. The first half of the season is pretty much over, we can't change what happened. This break will allow us to reset, and allow us to get our minds together, and then for us to come back and get back to work.""
Over the break, Payne wants his players to work on three crucial areas. He wants them to ""become a better passing team without panic"" and work on their turnovers, rebound the ball ""efficiently"" and defend ""desperately for as long as you're on the court."" Currently, Louisville commits 16.5 turnovers and secures 32.69 rebounds per game, while allowing opponents to shoot 46.4 percent from the field. The Cardinals ranks 340th, 306th and 317th, respectively, in Division I.
""I just if we could clear up those three things, I will feel better,"" Payne said. ""That's what I'm gonna be doing over the break, is looking at film and seeing how do we do it. 'What's another way? What else can we implement to help us understand how desperate we have to play defensively?' Because when we relax, teams are gonna go on 10-0 runs, 12-0 runs, and it's killing us.""
Louisville's Battle of the Bluegrass showdown at Kentucky is scheduled for Saturday, Dec. 31 at 12:00 p.m. EST.

https://www.si.com/college/louisville/football/marquis-groves-killebrew-commits,Texas A&M Transfer CB Marquis Groves-Killebrew Commits to Louisville,"The cornerback is now a Cardinal after just one season with the Aggies.
LOUISVILLE, Ky. - With the early signing period winding down, the Louisville football program is continuing to make splashes in the transfer portal, with former Texas A&M cornerback Marquis Groves-Killebrew announcing Wednesday that he has committed to the Cardinals.
Due to suffering a torn ACL in the final regular season game of his high school career, Groves-Killebrew was only able to see the field twice during his true freshman season at Texas A&M. He played a combined 21 defensive snaps against Ole Miss on Oct. 29 and vs. Florida on Nov. 5, logging a pair of tackles for the Aggies in the process.
When healthy, the 6-foot, 180-pound defensive back has the potential to be an elite defender. Coming out of high school, he ranked as the No. 11 player in the state of Georgia, the No. 13 cornerback and No. 114 prospect in the Class of 2022. While he didn't play due to injury, he was selected to last year's All-American Bowl.
During his senior season for Kennesaw (Ga.) North Cobb, Groves-Killebrew logged 38 tackles and two interceptions. Despite playing his high school ball in the Peach State, and being a long-time Georgia commit before flipping to the Aggies during last year's early signing period, he grew up in the city of Louisville.
Louisville is starting build back the depth in their secondary after losing several to the portal, graduation and NFL Draft, including All-ACC corner Kei'Trel Clark. Groves-Killebrew is now the third defensive back to transfer to Louisville over the course of the offseason, joining former Baylor safety Rodney Neal and former Arkansas corner/safety Myles Slusher.
At corner specifically, Groves-Killebrew could very well be a key reserve behind projected starters Quincy Riley and Jarvis Brownlee, even in just his second collegiate season. The Cardinals also bring back Trey Franklin and Derrick Edwards III, while signing four-star prospect Aaron Williams.
Groves-Killebrew is the seventh overall player to transfer to Louisville over the course of the offseason. Wide receivers Jadon Thompson and Jimmy Calloway; and defensive linemen Stephen Herron and Rodney McGraw also signed during the early signing period.
Louisville finished the 2022 season with an overall mark of 8-5 (4-4 in ACC), including a 24-7 win in the Fenway Bowl over Cincinnati.

https://www.si.com/college/louisville/football/transcript-2022-23-game-13-vs-nc-state,"What Kenny Payne, Louisville Players Said After 76-64 Loss at NC State","Read what the head coach of the Cardinals and forward Brandon Huntley-Hatfield said after their loss vs. the Wolfpack:
RALEIGH, N.C. - The Louisville men's basketball program kept it competitive with NC State, but a second half lapse spelled doom for the Cardinals, handing them a 76-64 loss to the Wolfpack.
Here's what head coach Kenny Payne and forward Brandon Huntley-Hatfield had to say following the loss:
(Opening statement)
First off, we played a very good team. A well coached team, very electric team, great in transition. Two really good guards that are dynamic. Their speed, their ability to get in the lane, their ability to make shots. They can make tough shots. I thought we did a decent job with them, and the big fellow, he was good. A good team, well coached team and a hard fought game. I thought we played hard, made a lot of mistakes. But overall, I thought we played okay. Still would like to have come out with a better result. I thought we proved that we can play with them, we just have to do it more consistently. They got 20-something more shots than us. Our 17 turnovers, their 12 offensive rebounds, that'll give them more shots than us. We have to do a better job, and be more physical, and rebound the ball, and we continually have to take care of basketball. If we're going to win games, we got to we got to get shots. In order to get shots, we can't give them the ball
(On why it took them so long to get their offense going)
Number one, I think their game plan was to press us to get us to slow down. Then what we did was, the game plan for us was once we get over half court, we know the play, go into the play. We have two plays that we can run, and I wanted us to get into them quick. Well, they wasn't for sure that they were finishing, trapping us, and so we would be hesitant. That's not the way I want to play. This sort of puts us on our heels. We began to process the game once we get over half court. Possessions where El Ellis, for example, may be trying to set up a play and think about the play, and he's taken two or three dribbles and time is running down. I need him to know what we're doing, and get into it quick, and let's go. Or just drive the ball. They're pressuring us anyway, just get in the lane and create offense for us or get it to the post. A lot of times, the best offense was just throwing it inside.
(On what he saw during NC State's 17-0 run)
Well, we talked about it in the first half. There was a point where we was in control, we were up two or three, whatever it was, maybe it was even, and then they went on a little bit of a run and we fought back to get back into the game. Second half, we knew it was gonna be a game of runs. It's gonna be a game of momentum. We know we're gonna face adversity. We've faced it every game this year. So embrace it, trust the process, stick to your discipline, stick to the game plan, and let's fight through it together. Let's not have one person or two people decide they're going to be the ones to bring us back. Stick to what we're doing. Be solid on defense. Don't give up a wide open shot. When we trap, we know we're zoning up after the trap. There were times where instead of zoning up, we were in scramble. So we ran to the wrong guy, which led to a dunk or a layup. We start the half, one of their best players goes off with six or eight points in a two minute span. That's not the game plan. So we have to look at it, assess it, what can we do better and go from there.
(On using the break to reset)
Well, I just told the guys, look, I want them to go home and have a couple of days of spending with their families, enjoy the Christmas break. But I also want them to think about what more they can do to bring more to the table. What more can they do, each individual, to help us get over the hump. I think they need this break, but I think they need it for a couple of reasons. Obviously, it's Christmas. Great time of the year. But also to mentally reflect on, ""what do I truly want? What do I truly want his team to be?"" The second half of this (season), it's coming fast, and we're gonna be playing some really good teams. So we have to be on point, we have to be 100% bought in, and go in there and fight for everything that we get.
(On seeing progress from Sydney Curry and Brandon Huntley-Hatfield)
I think I'm seeing progress. I'm seeing guys fight more. I've always said, ""Brandon, I brought you here to be a double-double guy."" I'm seeing a little bit of it. I want more of it. Sydney is coming along. I mean, the last three games he's played well. He's done some things that I like. I just need it more consistent. I need him to move his feet a little better defensively, I need him to fight for those one or two rebounds that he let get away because he relaxed for a second. But overall, I'm happy with where he's come. I'm happy with what Brandon is trying to do. I just need it to be consistent, if that makes sense.
(On what the one major thing is that they need to get fixed)
Well, it's not one thing. I wish I could say it was one thing. For me, if I can get three things done, if I can get us to, one: take care of our turnovers, become a better passing team without panic. Two: if I could get us to rebound the ball efficiently. Three: if I can get us to defend desperately for as long as you're on the court. So if that's 40 minutes, it's 40 minutes. I just if we could clear up those three things, I will feel better. That's what I'm gonna be doing over the break, is looking at film and seeing how do we do it. What's another way? What else can we implement to help us understand how desperate we have to play defensively? Because when we relax, teams are gonna go on 10-0 runs, 12-0 runs, and it's killing us.
(On being back inside Rupp Arena for the Louisville-Kentucky game next weekend)
I have not thought about it. Since you brought it up, I guess I have to think about it right now. But all I can tell you is that they have a bunch of talent over there, a great Hall of Fame coach, a well-oiled machine. They'll just young right now, and Coach Cal is gonna figure it out. It's gonna be a hard game. We're playing at their home where we all know the history of their wins at home, and what it means to go in there. I'm looking forward for our guys to see the challenge, to see their atmosphere. Hopefully we can get them to fight, to understand the magnitude of the rivalry of the two programs, and it's all around us - and I said this a while back - it's on us to to bring out part to the rivalry. I haven't thought much about it, I know they'll be well prepare for us. We just got to fight. We just have to fight.

https://www.si.com/college/louisville/basketball/recap-2022-23-game-13-nc-state,Louisville Taken Down by NC State to Extend ACC Winless Streak,"The Cardinals move to 0-3 in conference play for the first time since the 1997-98 season.
RALEIGH, N.C. - Heading back on the road roughly 48 hours removed from their loss at home to Lipscomb, the Louisville men's basketball program briefly resumed ACC play with a showdown against NC State, with a second half meltdown handing them a 76-64 loss Thursday night at PNC Arena.
The Cardinals fall to 2-11 to start the Kenny Payne era, and suffer their first 0-3 start to conference play since the 1997-98 season. Conversely, the Wolfpack move to 11-4 and pick up their first ACC win after an 0-2 start.
Louisville did manage to shoot 51.1 percent from the field and 4-of-8 on three-point attempts, but committed 17 turnovers to just four assists in the process. Meanwhile, NC State shot just 41.9 percent, but countered that by going 10-of-26 from long range. Combining the turnovers with NC State's 12 offensive rebounds, the Wolfpack got off 17 more shot attempts than the Cardinals.
Four of the Cardinals' finished in double figures, led by a 16-point effort from Sydney Curry. Ell Ellis amassed 15 points, Brandon Huntley-Hatfield poured in a 12 point and 12 rebound double-double, and Mike James had 10 points. All five of NC State's starters cracked double digits, with D.J. Burns having a game-best 17 points.
NC State opened up the game struggling to buy a basket, connecting on only four of their first 19 shots and just one of their first seven three-pointers. Even though Louisville had the opposite start, draining eight of their first 16 field goal attempts, they couldn't put meaningful distance between them and the Wolfpack due to turnovers and defensive rebounding issues.
With Louisville only leading by five with eight minutes left in the first half, NC State finally woke up, using a 9-0 run that was assisted by a 6-of-7 shooting stretch to take command of the game. However, the Cardinals didn't fold in the face of adversity, battling back to keep it competitive and see the Wolfpack only take a 31-28 lead into the locker room.
The competitive nature of the game didn't last long once the second half started. Louisville did use a small scoring burst once the half started to briefly tie the game, but then NC State delivered a counterpunch in the form of a 17-0 run to take compete control of the game.
The Cardinals were able to make it a 10-point game with just over eight minutes to go, but couldn't get out of their own way. Despite shooting 61.9 percent for the half, eight turnovers after halftime halted any real chance of a comeback.
Next up, Louisville has few extra days off for Christmas break, and will be back in action on New Year's Eve for the Battle of the Bluegrass at Kentucky. Tip-off against the Wildcats is set for Saturday, Dec. 31 at 1:00 p.m. EST.

https://www.si.com/college/louisville/football/deandre-moore-jr-signs,Texas Flips '23 Louisville WR Commit DeAndre Moore Jr.,"The wide receiver from Southern California was the Cardinals' top remaining commitment in the 2023 cycle.
LOUISVILLE, Ky. - The Louisville football program's top-rated commitment in the 2023 recruiting class is no longer in the fold.
Bellflower (Calif.) St. John Bosco wide receiver DeAndre Moore Jr., who had been committed to the Cardinals since late May, announced Thursday - the second day of the early signing period - that he has flipped his verbal pledge from Louisville to Texas and signed with the Longhorns.
He is the second Louisville commit to flip during the early signing period, following cornerback Rayquan Adkins' decision to sign with Cincinnati on Wednesday,
Moore had originally been committed to Oklahoma, but opted to decommit from the Sooners this past January following head coach Lincoln Riley's move to USC. It was widely expected that he would follow Riley to the Trojans, but Louisville inserted themselves into the mix immediately after he re-opened his recruitment.
Not long after his commitment to Louisville, he even opted to transfer from Los Alamitos (Calif.) HS to St. John Bosco and team up with fellow Cardinals commits Pierce Clarkson, Jahlil McClain and Aaron Williams.
But as the fall progressed, Texas and Georgia became legitimate threats for a potential flip, as his took official visits to both schools in early November. The risk of a flip increased dramatically this past weekend when Moore opted to take an unofficial visit to Texas instead of another official visit to Louisville right before the start of the early signing period.
Losing Moore is a huge blow to Louisville's recruiting class, as the 6-foot, 185-pound wideout is ranked as high as the No. 77 prospect in the nation, according to ESPN. With a 247Sports Composite rating of 0.9555, he was in line to be Louisville's sixth-highest ranked recruit in the modern recruiting era, and the third-highest from outside of the city of Louisville..
Moore was arguably the top pass catcher for St. John Bosco this season, catching 22 passes for a team-best 483 receiving yards and eight touchdowns. He helped the Braves go 13-1 on the year, clinching the CIF State Championship and the MaxPreps National Championship in the process.
Louisville is now back down to a 13-man 2023 recruiting class following Moore's decommitment. The Cardinals inked 12 prospects on Wednesday, the first day of the early signing period, with Inglewood (Calif.) tight end Jamari Johnson being the lone hold out.

RALEIGH, N.C. - Just two days removed from their previous time out against Lipscomb, the Louisville men's basketball program has a short turnaround in store, heading back on the road to face NC State.
The Cardinals were finally able to get some momentum going with a two-game win streak after dropping their first nine games, but that streak was snapped at the hands of the Bisons. Louisville shot 39.3 percent from the field to Lipscomb's 49.2 percent and were out-rebounded 40-26 en route to a 75-67 defeat this past Tuesday.
As for the Wolfpack, their first month-plus of the season has been met with a fair amount of success. Led by former UofL assistant coach Kevin Keatts and All-ACC guard Terquavion Smith, NC State has four wins over KenPom top-100 teams, and none of their three losses have come to a team ranked outside the top-70.

Led by former UofL assistant coach Kevin Keatts and All-ACC guard Terquavion Smith, NC State has four wins over KenPom top-100 teams, and none of their three losses have come to a team ranked outside the top-70.
This will be the 26th all-time meeting between Louisville and NC State, with the Cardinals holding a 14-11 series advantage. These two teams last faced on Jan. 12, 2022 at the KFC Yum! Center, with the Wolfpack claiming an 79-63 win.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. - Facing a plethora of uncertainty with their recruiting class given the head coaching change, the Louisville football program was able to overcome that and take a step in the right direction on Wednesday. On the first day of the 2022 Early Signing Period, the Cardinals were able to secure 18 Letters of Intent from their Class of 2023.

For those keeping track at home, the Cardinals had 18 signees on the first day of the Early Signing Period, but have 20 overall commits in the class across both the high school ranks and transfer portal.
It has been a heated battle between Louisville and Texas for 2023 wide receiver DeAndre Moore Jr., and he was originally supposed to sign Wednesday before he no-showed at St. John Bosco's signing ceremony. 2023 tight end Jamari Johnson, who Oregon is heavy after, opted to delay his announcement until Jan. 7 for the All-American Game.
As far as non-commits go, there are a few players on Louisville's immediate radar, especially in the transfer portal. Former Texas A&M cornerback Marquis Groves-Killebrew, former North Carolina cornerback Storm Duck and former Mississippi State running back Dillon Johnson - all three of whom visited campus last weekend - are names to keep an eye on.
There's also a pair of current 2023 Purdue commits that are potential Louisville flips. Tight end George Burhenn will sign this friday, while defensive end - and Louisville native - William 'Woo' Spencer won't sign until the traditional signing day in February.
Of course, they're still planning on hitting the transfer portal hard and heavy. Specifically, head coach Jeff Brohm said in his signing day press conference that they ""probably will add a quarterback"" and that they're ""looking to add a couple"" offensive lineman in the portal.
Sure, when you go by pure recruiting rankings, Madden Sanker and Aaron Williams were the two best high school prospects to sign on Wednesday. But the most impactful was undoubtedly Pierce Clarkson. Outside of anyone on Louisville's staff, he and his father, Steve, were the architects of this class and had a major hand in getting most of the top flight recruits in the fold due to peer-to-peer recruiting.
As far as the six transfers up to this point, it's a toss-up between Stephen Herron and Myles Slusher. Herron will allow Louisville to not have a drastic drop-off at defensive end with YaYa Diaby graduating, and Slusher is a versatile player that brings SEC-caliber experience and production.
Given how much Louisville struggled in the passing games this past season thanks in part to a perceived lack of depth at the wide receiver spot, this was an area where Louisville needed to upgrade - especially considering the depth they are losing at this position - and they succeeded. Thompson should contend for starting reps with returner Ahmari Huggins-Bruce, and Calloway has potential if he can tap into what made him a top-150 prospect and find his stride. Not to mention that both William Fowles and Jahlil McClain have long term potential. Wide receiver will be even better if Louisville can keep DeAndre Moore Jr. in the fold.
Louisville also did well when it came to the defensive line. Herron will likely be a starter as previously mentioned, Rodney McGraw should be a key depth piece in the middle of the line, and Adonijah Green has the potential to see meaningful snaps in year one. Micah Carter and Saadiq Clements have good long term upside as well.
When looking at the overall list of signees when sorted by position, it's pretty easy to figure out what needs to be addressed the most. Stanquan Clark is a phenomenal addition, but with Louisville losing Yasir Abdullah, MoMo Sanogo, Dorian Jones and (maybe?) Monty Montgomery, linebacker is arguably priority No. 1. Their second-biggest concern is at offensive line, considering the only regular starter they are returning is center Bryan Hudson.
Some major, major recognition needs to go to two people in particular. With so many assistant coaches departing the program and potentially leaving the entire recruiting class in flux, recruiting coordinators Pete Nochta and John 'Coach Hova' Herron were able to keep this class almost completely intact as they transitioned between Scott Satterfield and Jeff Brohm. Sure, Louisville did lose a couple commitments along the way, but they didn't lose nearly as much as a program typically does when changing coaches. Nochta, Herron, and everyone that assisted them deserve their flowers.
