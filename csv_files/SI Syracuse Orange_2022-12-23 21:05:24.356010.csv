Sellers had been committed to Syracuse since March, but elected to stay in-state when the Gamecocks decided to start recruiting him over the last month or so. The decision leaves the Orange without a quarterback for the 2023 recruiting cycle. 
Sellers was originally committed to Virginia when Jason Beck was the quarterbacks coach there, but flipped to Syracuse when Beck and offensive coordinator Robert Anae left the Cavs for the Orange. 
At the beginning of his junior season, Sellers suffered an injury that cost him the year. While most coaches backed off, coach Beck stuck with him despite the injury. South Carolina had not expressed any interest until a month or so ago. The Gamecocks then made a big push, pitching location and playing in front of friends and family.
Sellers had a monster senior year in which he led South Florence to an undefeated season and South Carolina State Championship. He threw for 2,949 yards with 45 touchdowns and two interceptions as a senior. In addition, Sellers ran for 1,337 yards and 22 more scores. He is listed at 6-3, 217 pounds.

https://www.si.com/college/syracuse/recruiting/jack-stonehouse-discusses-decision-to-transfer-to-syracuse,Jack Stonehouse Discusses Decision to Transfer to Syracuse,"Punter Jack Stonehouse had a strong 2022 season at Missouri but entered the portal anyway despite being the incumbent for next year. 
""One of the main reasons was I wanted to find a scholarship,"" Stonehouse said. ""After the season of playing, I didn't feel as though I was going to get a scholarship. I thought maybe my best chance was in the portal. I got some film, I got some stats and I really took a chance. I went into the portal just looking for a scholarship to be honest with you. When I went to Syracuse, it was head over heels. It was way more than I expected. I'm really happy about it. I think I made the right decision to better myself as a punter, start over, start from scratch. I think I took a chance and I ended up really happy with it."" 
Once in the portal, it did not take long for Syracuse to reach out and start the recruiting process. Special teams coordinator Bob Ligashesky and special teams quality control Will Rodriguez led the charge for the Orange. 
""It was coach Will Rodriquez and he reached out,"" Stonehouse said. ""Actually, coach Rodriguez and coach Ligashesky recruited me at different schools when I was in high school. Ligashesky was at Illinois and Rodriguez was at UCLA. It wasn't long, it might have been the day after (entering the portal) or two days after. They hit me up, they talked to me and right then I knew. Coach Ligashesky has so much background in special teams coaching. With those two guys, I really, really liked them before and the opportunity at Syracuse was so much better. Because they know exactly what they're talking about."" 
After initial contact, the Syracuse coaches discussed the opportunity to come in and compete for the starting punter gig. 
""Coach Ligashesky flew out to see me,"" Stonehouse said. ""He wanted to see me in person. We talked for a little bit and then I actually had a flight home to California or Christmas break that Friday. He came to see me on Thursday. Then he called me when he was at the airport and said 'how about you don't fly home and come to Syracuse?' I called my parents, cancelled my flight and I went out there. I know that there's two punters there on scholarship. I watched the practices and I think there's a really good shot at competing and winning that job."" 
During the official visit, Stonehouse was blown away by what Syracuse has to offer. 
""I had a really good host, Brady Denaburg, he's the kicker,"" Stonehouse said. ""He was telling me the ins, the outs, I got to hang out with all of the players at the meals. Obviously the big thing that everyone knows but punting in a dome. I walked in there for a basketball game and from the outside it looks gigantic gut when you're in there it looks awesome. I've only heard good things that it gets super loud in there. From start to finish I was taken care of and I appreciated it. All the dinners and what they had for us. I went home feeling extremely confident about the opportunity."" 
Stonehouse says he is excited about coming to Syracuse and is looking forward to making Orange fans cheer for special teams. 
""I'm from California and I'm extremely excited,"" Stonehouse said. ""It's extremely far away from California. I'm trying to make it as hard as possible for my parents to see a game, I'm sure that's what they think. I'm super excited. Me and coach Ligs and coach Rodriquez and the whole coaching staff, I think we're going to bring special teams up. I want to get special teams some recognition. I want people cheering for special teams. That's what I want. That's the goal.""

https://www.si.com/college/syracuse/recruiting/whats-left-for-syracuse-football-in-2023-recruiting-cycle,What's Left for Syracuse Football in 2023 Recruiting Cycle?,"Syracuse football signed more than a dozen recruits on the early National Signing Day and have added five transfers to its roster for the 2023 season. What is left for the Orange after adding those players to the program? Here is a breakdown of how I expect Syracuse to approach the late period.
Quarterback
There are two scenarios here. The first is the preferred for Syracuse but seemingly less likely based on the buzz surrounding the situation. LaNorris Sellers sticks with and signs with the Orange. The second more likely scenario is that Sellers signs with South Carolina. In the first scenario, Syracuse is done at quarterback in 2023 and there is no more work to be done. In the second, Syracuse has its work cut out for it moving forward. A transfer quarterback is unlikely as Syracuse has two young talented quarterbacks in Justin Lamson and Carlos Del Rio-Wilson on the roster. A transfer wants a great opportunity to start which is not what Syracuse currently offers. A junior college quarterback could be in play, but one would figure the Orange would want one with at least three years of eligibility remaining. A high school quarterback is more likely but more difficult to find. A vast majority of the top power five caliber quarterbacks signed early. That means, in order for Syracuse to add a quarterback to its 2023 class, the Orange will have to do a thorough evaluation to find an under the radar type quarterback. While that is not an easy task, Syracuse has lucked out with that in the past. One Eric Dungey was found in that exact scenario where Syracuse missed its top options and had to go back to the drawing board to find an under the radar quarterback. It did and the rest is history. While that was a different staff, there is every reason to trust Jason Beck's talent evaluation and ability to find a player he can develop. Still, it will not be an easy task.
Defensive Line
Even with four high school defensive linemen signed and one addition through the portal, defensive line help is still at the forefront for Syracuse's 2023 roster. Specifically through the portal. Finding one or two more players with experience and multiple years of eligibility remaining would be ideal. Perhaps one end and one tackle. Expect Syracuse to continue to monitor the portal and recruit players within it in order to improve defensive line depth for next season. That would give the Orange a nice mix of returning players, incoming freshmen and experienced additions to provide a much deeper defensive line than the 2022 roster. 
Wide Receiver
Syracuse has a lot of bodies at wide receiver and some that have shown flashes. D'Marcus Adams came on down the stretch of the season. Damien Alford has certainly flashed at times over the last two seasons. Umari Hatcher is still developing. Isaiah Jones had good moments prior to injury. Donovan Brown is highly regarded and impressed at practice last season as a true freshman. Trebor Pena has shown the ability to make big plays. But this group is losing a few players and is missing what would make a huge difference to this offense. A bonafide number one guy. I know Oronde Gadsden is there as the top target out of the tight end spot, but someone who can be a go to option on the outside would take a lot of pressure off of him. It would also prevent defenses from doubling Gadsden. Syracuse does not need to find guys just to find them. They need someone they think can be a difference maker. An Amba Etta-Tawo or Trishton Jackson type. Whether or not Syracuse finds one remains to be seen, but I would not be surprised if Syracuse looks to the portal to try to find one. 
Other Positions
Syracuse could certainly still target other positions, such as a high school defensive back as an example. Maybe a kicker if Syracuse does not feel Andre Szmyt's replacement is on the roster. However, what was noted above are the expected priorities moving forward. 
Dates to Know
The late signing period begins February 1, 2023 and ends April 1, 2023. 
It is a dead period until January 12th, so official visits for high school and junior college prospects can begin after that. 
Another dead period begins on January 30, 2023. That means official visits will have to take place the weekend of the 13th, 20th or 27th leading up to the late signing period. 
The transfer portal is open until January 18th. After that, anyone wishing to look for a new home has to wait until the spring open period, which is May 1st to May 15th. Transfers can sign at any time.

https://www.si.com/college/syracuse/recruiting/transfer-punter-jack-stonehouse-commits-to-syracuse,Transfer Punter Jack Stonehouse Commits to Syracuse,"Syracuse football has landed its fifth player from the transfer portal as Missouri punter Jack Stonehouse has picked the Orange as his next collegiate home. Stonehouse served as the Tigers primary punter last season, finished fifth in the SEC in net punting and has three years of eligibility remaining. 
Stonehouse came to Missouri as part of its 2021 recruiting class out of Chaminade High in California. As a senior, he averaged 46.7 yards per punt. He redshirted his first season at Missouri before punting in 10 games as a redshirt freshman in 2022. He averaged 42.3 yards per punt with nine over 50 yards and 15 that landed inside the 20 yard line. His long was 68 yards. 
As a team last season, Syracuse averaged only 39 yards per punt had significant struggles at the position with short shanked punts that gave opponents excellent starting field position. Now the Orange has a lot of competition at a key special teams position. 
It has been an offseason of change for Syracuse, which has lost both of its coordinators in the last week. Robert Anae took the offensive coordinator job at NC State while Tony White left to be Nebraska’s defensive coordinator. The Orange named Jason Beck its new offensive coordinator and Rocky Long its new defensive coordinator.

https://www.si.com/college/syracuse/recruiting/vincent-carroll-jackson-flips-from-syracuse-signs-with-nebraska,"Vincent Carroll-Jackson Flips From Syracuse, Signs With Nebraska","Syracuse football has lost one of its most recent verbal commitments. Vincent Carroll-Jackson, who stars for Central Dauphin East in Pennsylvania, signed with Nebraska on National Signing Day. The talented two-way lineman had verbally committed to the Orange on December 11th following an official visit. Less than one week later, he took an official to Nebraska which ultimately led to Wednesday's decision. 
Carroll-Jackson was one of the hottest prospects in the 2023 cycle in December, picking up power five offers from Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Pittsburgh, Nebraska, Rutgers and Syracuse. Several were recruiting him as a defensive lineman, but the Orange liked him on the offensive line. Syracuse's lead recruiter, Chris Achuff, had an in-home visit with Carroll-Jackson the week prior to the official visit.

Robert Anae took the offensive coordinator job at NC State while Tony White left to be Nebraska’s defensive coordinator. The Orange named Jason Beck its new offensive coordinator and Rocky Long its new defensive coordinator.
Meanwhile, the Orange continues to prepare for the Pinstripe Bowl against Minnesota. That game takes place on December 29th in Yankee Stadium.

https://www.si.com/college/syracuse/recruiting/trevion-mack-signs-with-syracuse,"Trevion Mack Signs With Syracuse, Flips From Northern Illinois","Syracuse football has flipped another class of 2023 prospect. Saint Paul (MN) Irondale offensive lineman Trevion Mack signed with the Orange after being committed to Northern Illinois since August. Mack officially visited Syracuse this past weekend, and that was enough to earn his signature during the early National Signing Day. 
Mack is listed at 6-5, 295 pounds and could play guard or tackle at the next level. Mack is part of a large contingent of offensive lineman Syracuse has added to its roster this cycle. He joins junior college prospects J'Onre Reed and Lysander Moeolo as well as high school prospect Jayden Bass. In addition, Syracuse has hit the transfer portal for additional held, landing a commitment from Richmond transfer Joe More. The Orange could pursue other transfers as well. 
It has been an offseason of change for Syracuse, which has lost both of its coordinators in the last week.

Position: Offensive Line
Height/Weight: 6-5, 295 lbs
School: Irondale High (MN)
Notable Offers: Northern Illinois
Recruiting Recap: Mack committed to Northern Illinois in August. The talented offensive lineman's recruitment was relatively quiet after that until December. Syracuse watched his senior film and elected to pursue. The Orange extended a scholarship offer, hosted him for an official visit and secured the flip on National Signing Day. 
Evaluation: Mack has great size and already looks like a collegiate offensive lineman. He gets to the second level with ease and plays to the echo of the whistle. What is noticeable about his film is that he frequently takes his assignment to the ground. That shows superior strength and playing with an attitude. You like both of those for any offensive lineman. Mack also moves very well for his size, as evidenced by his ability to get to the second level as previously mentioned. Those are great tools to work with. 
Mack showed a lot of improvement from his junior year to his senior season, which bodes well for his development at the collegiate level. He will need to continue to work on his footwork, playing with leverage and getting out of his stance quickly in order to excel against ACC caliber competition.

Quote: ""LeQuint Allen,"" Reed said. ""Him. That was why. I haven't seen a running back like that ever. That comes from getting a back 1,000 yard seasons. He was just different. The way he practiced, he reminded me of myself as far as the way he practiced and carried himself. Fun person outside of football but when you're within those four white lines it's business. I've seen it. Having somebody like that to toss the ball behind, why wouldn't you want to block a guy for him? Two, three maybe."" 
Evaluation: J'Onre Reed is an intriguing center prospect who is extremely mobile, has a tremendous frame and plays with extreme physicality. Reed is willing to pull and can get to the second level, which gives offenses a lot of options. He is physical at the point of attack, plays with a chip on his shoulder and loves to open up holes for his running back. In pass protection, Reed holds up there as well using his hands to keep linemen at arm's length and a strong lower body to combat bull rushes. Refining technique and learning the offense will be keys for him this spring as he looks to take over the center spot next season.

School: Woodlawn High (MD)
Notable Offers: Temple
Quote: ""I felt loved the minute I met the team,"" Omopariola said. ""The coaches and players had a family like bond which I found very unique.""
Evaluation: Omopariola was a late name to the Syracuse recruiting cycle. The Orange saw him at an all star game in late November and lead recruiter Mike Johnson quickly worked to set up a visit. The official happened the weekend before National Signing Day and sealed the deal in his recruitment. 
Omopariola is an intriguing prospect. He is from Nigeria and came to the United States in 2022, so he is relative new to the game. Still, his frame at 6-4, 250 pounds with natural elite athleticism gives him an extremely high ceiling. He could stay around his current weight with adding perhaps 10-15 more pounds and play at defensive end. Another option is to add 30-40 pounds and slide inside to tackle. He has the frame for both. 
Once he arrives, Omopariola needs to learn the playbook and work on fundamentals as he is still on the raw side. If he develops, he has the potential to be a huge steal for the Orange.

Position: Linebacker
Height/Weight: 6-2, 210 lbs
School: Greenwood High (SC)
Notable Offers: Appalachian State, Coastal Carolina
Recruitment Recap: Jeffery was not someone Syracuse was tied to publicly throughout his recruitment. However, he took a surprise official visit the weekend before National Signing Day and shut down his recruitment thereafter. On Wednesday, he inked with the Orange. 
Evaluation: When watching Jeffery's film, his ability to shed blocks immediately stands out. That is a very desirable trait as linebackers look to make that transition from the high school to the collegiate level. Then, as you watch further, more desirable traits are on display. 
Jeffery is quick to identify the ball carrier, makes tackles in one on one situations in the open field and is comfortable blitzing off the edge. Combine that with a good frame, and you have an intriguing prospect who has the potential to make an impact on special teams early along with pushing for a spot in the two deep within a couple of years. 
It is hard to gauge Jeffery's speed on film, though he does appear to be above average in that category. The key for Jeffery will be to add a bit of muscle to his frame, get a little stronger and settle into a role either as an inside or outside backer.
