https://www.si.com/nfl/seahawks/news/seattle-seahawks-tariq-woolen-pro-bowl-vote-rookie-kansas-city-chiefs,Seahawks Tariq Woolen 'Pro Bowl Goal'? CB Reveals View of 'Reward',"Seattle Seahawks rookie cornerback Tariq Woolen has been patience during his approach to a stellar season.
Seattle Seahawks rookie cornerback Tariq Woolen was named a 2022 Pro Bowler on Thursday, per a release of the All-Star rosters. It came as little surprise too, given he's been racking in votes amid a stellar season.
But was making the Pro Bowl ever a goal on his Christmas list? 
""No, not really,"" Woolen said. ""I just was gaining votes. But at the same time, whenever you do the right things ... you get rewarded. This is one of the rewards and one of the blessings that I get to reap"" 
Woolen admitted that he was focused on succeeding at little things as a defensive back before overstepping his goals. Getting too ahead of himself could've resulted in no kind of recognition. 
Instead, he took it one league-leading interception at a time. 
Woolen is currently tied with New Orleans Saints cornerback CJ Gardner-Johnson for a league-leading six interceptions. Woolen had an interception in four straight games from Weeks 3 through 6. 
The Defensive Rookie of the Year might be his to lose. But for now, he's focusing on the next task at hand.
The Seahawks (7-7) take on the Kansas City Chiefs (11-3) at Arrowhead on Christmas Eve on Saturday.

https://www.si.com/nfl/seahawks/news/seattle-seahawks-nfl-mock-draft-first-round-tcu-horned-frogs-quention-johnston,Seahawks Draft Elite WR Prospect in Latest NFL Mock,"The Seahawks are certainly not lacking for offensive weapons, but this mock draft has them adding another.
While the regular season comes to an end and the Seattle Seahawks still find themselves in the playoff hunt, looking at mock drafts for 2023 are still somewhat of a necessity. 
After all, when you own nine picks, two of which are in the first round, you're going to have a lot of different mock draft options. Which, for a playoff contending Seattle team, could further expedite its journey back to being Super Bowl contention.
In its latest mock, Yahoo Sports has the Seahawks taking a defensive playmaker and offensive playmaker with their two first round picks.
They had the Seahawks taking Georgia defensive lineman Jalen Carter with the No. 3 overall pick, which is a common pick due to Seattle's need on the defensive line. However, who they had the Seahawks taking with the current No. 15 overall pick might surprise some. 
No. 15 - Quentin Johnston (WR - TCU)
The Seahawks had a tough time finding a true No. 3 receiver and tight end Noah Fant hasn’t made the impact we thought he would. Johnston (6-foot-4, 193 pounds) would be guaranteed to change all that. His numbers don’t scream out superstar, but he’s ranked the No. 1 receiver in this draft class for a reason. Adding Johnston would give Seattle a receiver trio that no other NFL team could match.
At first glance this pick feels like a luxury pick, and it possibly is when you consider the Seahawks already have DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett on the roster. However, a third weapon of Johnston's caliber would make the Seattle offense nearly impossible to stop.
This season Johnston recorded 903 receiving yards and five touchdowns on 53 receptions, averaging 17 yards per catch. 
Whether or not Johnston is the guy for Seattle with one of their first round picks is yet to be seen, but it is definitely fun to imagine how potent an offense would be with a receiving trio of Metcalf, Lockett and Johnston with Kenneth Walker III in the backfield.

The Kansas City Chiefs still have aspirations of being the No, 1 seed in the AFC, while the Seattle Seahawks are still trying to punch their ticket to the postseason.
A win by either team won't help them, but a loss could ruin those hopes.
Kansas City and the Buffalo Bills are tied for the AFC's best record at 11-3, but the Bills hold the tiebreaker. A loss on Saturday could put that goal out of reach.
The Seahawks are 7-7 and have lost four of their last five, and have yet to clinch an NFC playoff spot.
Seattle's biggest issue has been health ... or lack thereof. Wideout Tyler Lockett is out with an injury and running back Kenneth Walker III has been nursing an ankle, but should play on Saturday.
“Let’s just start with this game. We’ve got to play really sharp football across the board,” Seattle coach Pete Carroll said. ""We have to take advantage of all the opportunities that we get. We’ve got to catch the interceptions, we’ve got to stay onside and not give them things. We have to make them have to work and play a championship-style game.
“If we can do that,” Carroll said, “now we are getting to our capabilities.”

https://www.si.com/nfl/seahawks/news/quandre-diggs-seattle-seahawks-relishes-pro-bowl-overcoming-severe-injury,Respect Earned: 'Blessed' Seahawks S Quandre Diggs Relishes Third Consecutive Pro Bowl Nod,"With just two interceptions so far, Quandre Diggs hasn't been quite as dominant in the secondary for the Seattle Seahawks as he was in 2020 and 2021. But coming off a scary injury, he has remained productive in his eighth season and as evidenced by a lack of targets as well as Pro Bowl votes, remains highly-regarded by his peers.
RENTON, Wash. - After coming up short as an alternate selection in 2018 and 2019, Quandre Diggs finally got over the proverbial Pro Bowl hump with the Seahawks in 2020, earning his first all-star selection while leading the eventual NFC West champions with five interceptions.
Even though he knew he wouldn't get to actually play in the Pro Bowl due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Diggs soaked up the special moment he felt he had earned in the previous two seasons. At that time, the former sixth-round pick out of Texas hadn't achieved a greater individual accomplishment in his NFL career and the honor was a culmination of all the hard work he had put in on the field to develop into one of the league's premier playmaking ball hawks.
Two years later, however, on the heels of Diggs earning his third consecutive Pro Bowl nod on Wednesday, that first selection no longer sits atop his personal mantle. Not after what the star safety endured and ultimately conquered this offseason recovering from a gruesome injury.
""The first one is special, the second one is cool, but when you come off something that I came off of, you guys have seen the videos, and it’s on the internet every day. People tag you in those things and you see those things, so you kind of look up and thank God that you are able to be out here and be able to play this game,"" Diggs said of his third Pro Bowl. ""I have been blessed to play every snap and go out there and compete with my guys. Who would have thought in January that I would have been able to do that? This one is definitely special and definitely means more because knowing what I went through last offseason.”
Back in January, Diggs suffered a dislocated ankle and a fractured fibula in the fourth quarter of a Week 18 win over the Cardinals while tackling running back Eno Benjamin, bringing another fantastic season in which he had intercepted a team-high five passes to a devastating conclusion. It was an emotional scene in Glendale with teammates such as cornerback D.J. Reed dropping to their knees and unable to fight back tears for their fallen comrade as he was carted off the field.
Less than 10 minutes away from becoming an unrestricted free agent for the first time, the injury could not have come at a worse time for Diggs, who was set to hit the market as one of the top defenders available. Instead, with receiver Tyler Lockett also making the trip, he flew to Green Bay and had his ankle repaired by renowned surgeon Robert Anderson, putting his status heading into free agency in a bit of limbo.
""Never take your accomplishments for granted because I keep telling people that less than a year ago, I couldn’t walk,"" Diggs remarked. ""You have to take all of that stuff and take it in stride. Sometimes you forget those things.”
Through it all, as evidenced by Lockett staying in Arizona and traveling to Green Bay for the surgery, the well-respected Diggs had a constant outpouring of support from teammates, players on other teams, and family. Dodging a bullet without any ligament damage in his ankle, he maintained a positive mindset and the Seahawks rewarded him for his outstanding play by signing him to a three-year, $40 million contract shortly after free agency opened in March.
By the time Seattle conducted mandatory minicamp in June, Diggs was close to 100 percent recovered, participating in walkthrough drills along with fellow safety Jamal Adams, who also was returning from an offseason procedure to repair a torn labrum in his left shoulder. Two months later, he reported for the start of training camp and immediately jumped back into the starting lineup with plenty of spring in his step.
As noted by coach Pete Carroll on Thursday, Diggs' fourth season with the Seahawks hasn't always been smooth sailing coming back from the injury. Unlike previous seasons where he has been a football magnet, he has missed out on several interception opportunities, including letting an errant pass by 49ers rookie Brock Purdy bounce off his chest in a 21-13 loss in Week 15. Per Pro Football Focus, he has dropped four interceptions, tied for the most among safeties, and has also missed 11 tackles in 14 starts, tied for the second-most on the team.
Leading up to a Week 8 matchup with the Giants, Diggs admitted he may have been playing a bit hesitant earlier in the season coming off the ankle injury, which contributed to a somewhat slow start by his standards both in coverage and as a tackler.
But while Carroll acknowledged Diggs has left more plays on the field than usual, he still has had a stellar campaign and his leadership in a young secondary featuring two rookie starters in budding star Tariq Woolen and Coby Bryant has been invaluable, especially with Adams lost for the season to a torn quad in Week 1. For that reason, he isn't surprised to see Diggs join Earl Thomas, Kam Chancellor, and Kenny Easley as only the fourth safety in franchise history with three or more Pro Bowl selections.
            “He’s played a really tough season. He keeps letting you know who he is by the way he knocks people around, the way he makes his plays,"" Carroll said of Diggs. ""He has had an unfortunate run of not converting a few interceptions. He should have five or six [picks] easily right now. That’s crushing to him because he’s a ballhawk. He’s an interceptor and last week, we had a great one and two that we didn’t get, but he’s had a couple of overthrows. He’s had some shots at it. He should’ve had five or six like I said, which would’ve changed everyone’s perspective on everything. He’s our guy. He’s our leader back there and we need him.”
Even with his interception numbers being down compared to the past three seasons where he ranked among league leaders, Diggs has still been a viable center fielder locking up the back of Seattle's defense. According to PFF, he has allowed the fourth-fewest receptions (10) and third-lowest completion rate (52.6) in coverage among qualified safeties with at least 330 coverage snaps. He also ranks a respectable sixth in yards allowed (135) and ninth in passer rating (71.1).
On top of those quality numbers as a pass defender, Diggs ranks fourth on the Seahawks with 64 combined tackles and has added a pair of pressures and a quarterback hit on just five blitzing opportunities.
Though all of those statistics paint a different picture in regard to Diggs' play this season, nothing may be more telling about the respect opponents have for him than the general lack of targets in his direction. As has been the case ever since he arrived via trade from Detroit midway through the 2019 season, opposing quarterbacks rarely test the seams or throw post routes against the Seahawks because of No. 6's presence and he has only been targeted 19 times total.
That league-wide respect could be seen on social media with the rush of tweets and messages from players and coaches wishing him well after he suffered his injury 11 months ago. Much to the delight of a thankful Diggs, that respect also carried over into Pro Bowl voting with his peers showing their admiration by vaulting him into the top spot at free safety for a third straight year, something he will not take for granted after all that he overcame to return to the field last spring.
“Man, it feels good. It’s always good to be honored by fans and of course by my peers and coaches. For me, that’s the most important thing, the respect around the league. I don’t really care what everybody else has to say, it’s more of what guys see me do every week. Obviously, my peers feel a certain way about me, so I’m blessed.”

https://www.si.com/nfl/seahawks/news/seattle-seahawks-rookie-class-top-five-tariq-woolen-coby-bryant-kenneth-walker,Seahawks Dynamic Rookie Class Lands in Top Five of NFL,"Whether or not the Seahawks make the playoffs, their rookies have shown they have franchise cornerstones in place.
With three games left in the season, the Seattle Seahawks sit at 7-7 and are still in the hunt for a playoff spot, which is far from where most people thought they would be at this point. 
However, despite preseason expectations, the Seahawks have proven this was not a rebuilding season. Yes, the resurgence of quarterback Geno Smith into an MVP-caliber player has certainly been a catalyst for Seattle's success, but he is far from the sole reason. 
Rather, the fact that the Seahawks absolutely crushed the 2022 draft has gone a long way toward their playoff contention. As such, Bucky Brooks of NFL.com believes they're the No. 2 overall rookie class this season, and it's hard to argue against that.
On offense, a trio of Seahawk rookies has made a name for themselves. Charles Cross and Abraham Lucas have cemented themselves as anchors at the tackle positions for the foreseeable future, blocking for fellow rookie running back Kenneth Walker III.
Walker has served as a major catalyst for the Seahawks' offense as he's forced defenses to stay honest. He's put up Offensive Rookie of the Year numbers, rushing for 696 yards and nine touchdowns on 150 carries. 
Not to be left out, the Seahawks also have a Defensive Rookie of the Year contender in cornerback Tariq Woolen. The fifth-round pick out of UTSA has had no trouble transitioning to the NFL, recording 51 tackles and six interceptions en route to earning Pro Bowl honors. 
Woolen's fellow rookie cornerback Coby Bryant has also shown flashes this season as well with 58 total tackles and four forced fumbles. 
The Seahawks may not ultimately make the playoffs this season, but even if they don't this season has been a smashing success. They know now that their rookies are franchise cornerstones, and with plenty of picks in the 2023 draft, well, the future is bright in Seattle once again.

https://www.si.com/nfl/seahawks/news/ryan-neal-al-woods-ruled-out-seattle-seahawks-kansas-city-chiefs,"Ryan Neal, Al Woods Ruled Out For Seahawks Pivotal Week 16 Matchup at Chiefs","Along with missing one of their best offensive weapons, the Seattle Seahawks will be down two key starters on defense against Kansas City's top-ranked scoring machine.
Already set to play minus star receiver Tyler Lockett as he recovers from hand surgery, the Seahawks will also be without the services of starting defensive tackle Al Woods and Ryan Neal against the Chiefs in Saturday's must-win Christmas Eve contest at Arrowhead Stadium.
Earlier this week, coach Pete Carroll wasn't sure whether Neal or Woods would be able to bounce back and play by Saturday, indicating Seattle would handle their situations day to day. Unfortunately, neither player practiced at all this week due to knee and heel injuries respectively and with less than 48 hours until kickoff, the team officially ruled both of them out on Thursday's final injury report.
Playing banged up for the past several weeks, Neal has gutted through shoulder, elbow, and knee injuries. Struggling to get through the final quarter against the 49ers last Thursday night, the Seahawks opted to shut him down this weekend with hopes he can be ready to play against the Jets in Week 17.
As for Woods, the veteran nose tackle aggravated what Carroll called an ""old"" Achilles injury in a Week 14 loss to Carolina. While he was listed as questionable to face San Francisco, he ultimately didn't dress and will now miss his second consecutive game.
In Neal's absence, the Seahawks could turn to former first-round pick Johnathan Abram, who has played four defensive snaps in his first two games with the team since being claimed off waivers from the Packers earlier this month. Ex-Florida standout Teez Tabor also may be in consideration after logging substantial snaps as a dime defender in the past three games.
While Seattle has decent options to fill in for Neal at safety, the situation may be far more dire at defensive tackle. The team lost Bryan Mone to a season-ending ACL injury last week and placed him on injured reserve on Tuesday, leaving them with minimal depth at the nose position minus Woods.
As they did against the 49ers on Thursday, Poona Ford and Myles Adams will likely see the bulk of snaps playing nose tackle, while Shelby Harris could also see a few plays there if needed. With those three players all rotating inside, immediate snaps at the 3-tech spot may be available for former Iowa star Daviyon Nixon, who the team signed as a free agent on Wednesday.
At receiver, Seattle knew Lockett would not be available this week after having a broken bone in his left hand repaired on Monday. Carroll expressed optimism that the Pro Bowl wideout could return as quickly as next week against New York, but with him sidelined for at least one game and Marquise Goodwin listed as questionable with wrist/ankle issues, quarterback Geno Smith will likely have to lean on receivers who haven't played much this year amid frigid winter temperatures.
Among those standing to gain from Lockett and/or Goodwin's absence, seventh-round pick Dareke Young has gradually seen increased playing time on offense as the season has progressed and former Vikings first-round pick Laquon Treadwell was signed off the practice squad on Monday. Versatile veteran Penny Hart will also be active, while the Seahawks have a trio of receivers on the practice squad they can elevate for game day if needed.
In additional injury news, running backs Ken Walker III and DeeJay Dallas both received questionable designations as they continue to deal with lingering ankle injuries. Despite starting against the 49ers last week, Walker hasn't practiced for precautionary reasons as the Seahawks manage his workload, while Dallas sat out the past two games and was limited in Wednesday's practice.
In the event Walker or Dallas doesn't suit up, Seattle re-signed veteran Wayne Gallman to its practice squad and also has Darwin Thompson and Godwin Igwebuike available to elevate to the roster before Saturday's game. The team did release Tony Jones Jr. in a corresponding move to sign Nixon, leaving the team with less backfield depth.
The Seahawks may also enter Saturday's contest without tight end Noah Fant, who has been sidelined at practice this week due to a knee injury. He received a questionable designation and likely will be a game-time decision.

https://www.si.com/nfl/seahawks/news/geno-smith-seattle-seahawks-cold-weather-blues-kansas-city-chiefs,Cool Geno? QB May Be Key to Seahawks Bucking Cold Weather Blues vs. Chiefs,"Set to play in one of their coldest games in franchise history at Arrowhead Stadium on Christmas Eve, the Seattle Seahawks will have to overcome more than 40 years of poor fortunes in frigid temperatures to keep their playoff hopes alive against one of the AFC's best teams. Luckily, they have a quarterback who looks well-equipped for such a situation.
RENTON, Wash. - Reeling with four losses in their past five games, the Seahawks will enter Saturday's Christmas Eve contest against the AFC West champion Chiefs as a heavy underdog for several reasons.
For one, Kansas City has a leading MVP candidate in star quarterback Patrick Mahomes under center orchestrating the NFL's top scoring offense. Defensively, the trio of Chris Jones, Frank Clark, and Carlos Dunlap wreaks havoc rushing the passer each week, creating a nightmare matchup for a Seattle offensive line that has struggled mightily over the past month and change.
Compounding matters for coach Pete Carroll's squad, the Seahawks will have to not only deal with Mahomes, Jones, and company. On top of the significant personnel advantages the Chiefs appear to have on both sides of the football, they also will be playing at Arrowhead Stadium, one of the most unwelcoming stadiums for road teams in the league, with temperatures expected to hover below zero on the field.
Bracing for one of those coldest games in franchise history, Carroll didn't seem phased by the prospects of frigid temperatures when asked on Tuesday if any special preparations needed to be made to battle the elements.
            “Not much, we can’t do much about it,"" Carroll said. ""It’s going to be just as cold on their side too, so we just have to be ready. There is going to be some clothing that we will wear that will help us adapt.”
While Carroll is right that both teams will have to deal with the chilly temperatures and possible snow on Saturday in Kansas City, such weather conditions have not treated Seattle too kindly in 47 seasons as a franchise.
Dating back to their inaugural season in 1976, the Seahawks have played in only 14 games with the temperature at kickoff under 25 degrees Fahrenheit, compiling a 3-11 record for a dismal 0.214 win percentage. Playing games at the King Dome through the 1999 season, all but one of those games came on the road, with the lone outlier being a 25-24 loss to the Bears at Lumen Field last December.
Since Carroll arrived from USC in 2010, Seattle hasn't fared any better in cold weather games, posting a 1-4 record and a .200 win percentage. Among the four defeats with him on the sideline, the Seahawks lost to a 24-20 heartbreaker to the Chiefs amid chilly temperatures at Arrowhead Stadium in 2014.
Fortunately, Carroll's lone win in arctic conditions did come in the postseason as the Seahawks edged the Vikings 10-9 in the 2016 wild card round, sneaking out of Minnesota with a victory after kicker Blair Walsh shanked a short field goal wide left in the closing seconds.
With the actual temperature being negative six degrees that afternoon, Carroll remembers ""Ice Bowl II"" vividly, reminiscing about his mentor and long-time Vikings coach Bud Grant taking the field in short sleeves before the opening kickoff.
            “It doesn’t matter how cold it is, you can still go out there and play wherever you are going and win the football game. That was a great experience for us,"" Carroll commented. ""The thing I remember most was Bud [Grant] pregame, he was the biggest stud in the whole stadium.”
With that postseason triumph being more than half a decade ago, the Seahawks don't have many players remaining on the roster who dressed to play inside a freezer in Minneapolis. Away from Carroll and a few other members of the coaching staff, only receiver Tyler Lockett and outside linebacker Bruce Irvin were with the team at TCF Bank Stadium.
Even since their last cold weather game against Chicago on a rare snow day in Seattle last December, the Seahawks have undergone substantial turnover. Russell Wilson was still under center in that game, taking a critical third down sack that ultimately may have cost his team three points in crunch time, while Bobby Wagner still roamed the middle of the defense at linebacker.
If there's a reason for optimism with cold weather and snow in the forecast for Saturday, after Wilson struggled for years in such games, Geno Smith may be a massive upgrade in sub-zero temperatures based on his track record.
Though he grew up in Miami, Florida and never had to worry about playing in such conditions at the high school level, Smith gained plenty of experience throwing the pigskin in below freezing temperatures while starring at West Virginia. In fact, he played some of his best football in those games, throwing for over 1,200 yards and 10 touchdowns with no interceptions while leading the Mountaineers to a 4-1 record in cold weather contests.
Drafted by the Jets in the second round in 2013, Smith interestingly only played in one game with temperatures below 32 degrees, completing 18 out of 29 passes for 255 yards, a touchdown, and an interception in a 30-24 loss at Minnesota in 2014.
When asked how he alters his preparation for cold games, Smith said aside from having handwarmers available, he sticks to his usual routine. As for whether or not the elements impact his ability to grip and throw the football, he believes wind has a far greater impact than lower temperatures and as long as the ball is properly inflated, it shouldn't be an issue for him on Saturday.
            “You have to stay warm, keep the blood flowing, and keep the body warm. I don’t really prepare differently,"" Smith stated. ""Some guys are different, every guy is different, so it’s custom to the person. For me, it’s pretty much the same. As long as I have a handwarmer and a nice jacket, I think I will be all right.”
Of course, while Smith may be more than comfortable throwing a cold football, he will be throwing to a receiving corps without Lockett, who underwent surgery to repair a broken bone in his left hand on Monday. Regardless of who steps up in his absence, hauling in passes in chilly weather can feel like trying to catch a large rock and it will be interesting to see how weather impacts that aspect of the game.
Still, all season long, Smith has been a beacon of calm and poise under center for Seattle, reviving his career with 26 touchdown passes and a 71.4 percent completion rate to earn his first Pro Bowl nod on Wednesday. For his team to pick up a crucial win as 10-point underdogs on Sunday and curb prior tribulations playing in frigid temperatures, he will have to remain a cool customer in the pocket with Jones, Clark, and Dunlap trying to hunt him down in a loud, hostile environment and deliver accurate strikes to his bevy of weapons.
As for Smith's teammates, echoing what Carroll said on Tuesday, excelling in cold weather boils down to mindset more than anything. As long as they aren't thinking about how cold they are and remember the opponent has to deal with the same conditions, they should be able to adjust accordingly, giving them the best chance for success in a game few expect them to win to keep their slim playoff hopes alive.

In their final road game of the regular season, the Seattle Seahawks travel to face the Kansas City Chiefs in Arrowhead Stadium on Christmas Eve. ... with the hope of somehow ""unwrapping'' K.C. QB Patrick Mahomes.
The Seahawks have lost four out of their last five games and currently sit outside of the NFC Playoffs looking in. Seattle fell to NFC West Division rival San Francisco last Thursday, sealing the 49ers as division champions. 
At 7-7 now, Seattle is behind both the New York Giants and Washington Commanders for the remaining two NFC Wild Card spots. Meanwhile, in the AFC the Chiefs are aiming for the top seed currently occupied by the Buffalo Bills. Kansas City is fresh off an overtime win against the Houston Texans.
At the core of Seattle's recent struggles is the inability of the defense to stop the run, allowing over 200 yards on the ground per game since Week 10. The Seahawks have also had problems getting the rushing attack going on offense, averaging under 65 rushing yards per game since Week 10. 
RECORDS: Seattle Seahawks (7-7) vs. Kansas City Chiefs (11-3)
ODDS: Seattle is a 9.5-point underdog vs. the Chiefs.

LOCATION: Arrowhead Stadium (Kansas City, MO)
TV/RADIO: FOX, Seattle Sports 710AM • KIRO Newsradio 97.3 FM
THE FINAL WORD: After undergoing surgery to repair a broken bone in his left hand on Monday afternoon, Tyler Lockett could return as soon as New Year's Day to face the New York Jets.
""He had his surgery and the doctor said it was perfect,"" Carroll said. ""He had a lot of work done, but it's very, very secure and so they feel very good about him coming back quickly.""

https://www.si.com/nfl/seahawks/news/seattle-seahawks-franco-harris-steelers-dead-obit-geno-smith-pro-bowl,Geno Smith Leads 4 Seattle Seahawks To Pro Bowl Team,"Follow along with AllSeahawks.com as we keep you up to date with all firings, hirings, and breaking news in the NFL.
DEC 21 FOUR TO PRO BOWL The Seattle Seahawks will be represented in the 2023 Pro Bowl by four players, the NFL announced. Quandre Diggs and Jason Myers will be going back, and a pair of first-timers - the vet QB Geno Smith and the rookie corner Tariq Woolen - will be joining them.
DEC 21 FRANCO PASSES AWAY Franco Harris, the former Steelers all-time great who finished his Hall of Fame career with the Seahawks, has passed away at the age of 72.
Harris, the running back known in the football world for “The Immaculate Reception,'' was part of four Steelers Super Bowl winners. Harris played 13 years in the NFL – 12 with the Steelers and one with the Seahawks in 1984 before the nine-time Pro Bowler retired.
Harris' death comes on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the play that marked Pittsburgh jump to title contention NFL’s elite and just before this weekend's plan to retire his No. 32 during a ceremony at halftime of the Steelers game against the Las Vegas Raiders - the same team he victimized with the wild carom-catch for a winning TD in a playoff game against Oakland in 1972.
DEC 20 TREADWELL SIGNED
Wide receiver Laquon Treadwell has been elevated from the practice squad to the Seahawks roster three times this season, meaning a decision is due: Call him up again and he's eventually subjected to waivers. Or ...
Sign Treadwell to the active roster, which ESPN reports is now in the works on Tuesday.
Treadwell, Minnesota's first-round pick in 2016, has one catch for one yard in his three appearances this year and has helped on special teams.
DEC 15 LOCKET INJURED
During their crushing defeat to the San Francisco 49ers on Thursday night, the Seattle Seahawks may have also suffered a devastating personnel loss, with wideout Tyler Lockett being forced to leave the game with a broken index finger.
Pete Carroll updated the media on Lockett's status following the game. 
Carroll expects Lockett to miss time due to the injury. 
""I can't even fathom it,"" Carrol said. ""I can't fathom playing without Tyler.""
DEC 13 MISSING DEEBO The San Francisco 49ers are 9-4 and in the driver's seat in the NFC West as they approach Thursday's visit to Seattle. It's all feel-good ... maybe even eventually for do-it-all star Deebo Samuel.
He left Sunday's 35-7 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the second quarter with what looked like a leg injury. ... and the famously tough and talented Samuel was carted away in tears.
But now it's possible that Samuel - who has issues with his knee and ankle - may make it back sometime before the end of the season.
The 49ers have some breathing room in the division, with Seattle at 7-6 chasing. Samuel will be watching on Thursday, but as the playoffs approach? Deebo - who has caught 54 passes for 612 yards and two touchdowns this season while also rushing 41 times for 228 yards and three scores - will merit watching.
DEC 11 WILSON CONCUSSION Russell Wilson was knocked out of the game against the Chiefs with a concussion on Sunday, all part of the Broncos' 34-28 loss.
Wilson has experienced a dismal season for the 3-10 Broncos since orchestrating his way out of Seattle via a blockbuster trade.
First-year Broncos coach Nathaniel Hackett said Wilson is now entered into the concussion protocol. His status for the game next Sunday against Arizona is uncertain.
“He was fighting the whole game. I give him so much credit,” Hackett said of Wilson. “He was playing really well.”
DEC 11 WOODS OUT The Seattle Seahawks appear to be without one of their best defensive linemen for the rest of their Sunday matchup with the Carolina Panthers, with Al Woods listed as doubtful to return with a heel injury, per Seahawks Public Relations. 
The Seahawks trailed 20-14 at the time of the injury. 
DEC 10 LAQUON UP The Seattle Seahawks have made a trio of roster moves in advance of Sunday's game against the Carolina Panthers, including the elevation of receiver Laquon Treadwell from the practice squad.
With injuries to Ken Walker and DeeJay Dallas, Travis Homer, Tony Jones and elevated Godwin Igwebuike are in play at running back,
Additionally, Jon Rhattigan has been activated off the PUP list.
DEC. 6 SEAHAWKS SIGN WAYNE GALLMAN
The Seattle Seahawks reportedly added some running depth to their offense on Tuesday, signing veteran running back Wayne Gallman to the practice squad.
Gallman comes in at a position of need for the Seahawks, who are already short at the position. Not to mention that starting running back Ken Walker III is currently battling an ankle injury. 
Originally drafted by the  Giants in the fourth round of the 2017 NFL Draft out of Clemson, Gallman spent four seasons in New York rushing 338 times for 1,444 yards (4.3 yards per carry) and nine touchdowns in 43 games, with 14 starts. 
Last season, Gallman spent time on both the Atlanta Falcons and Minnesota Vikings playing in eight games and rushing 28 times 104 yards. 
He was also briefly on the Kansas City Chiefs practice squad earlier this season.
DEC. 4 JIMMY GAROPPOLO CARTED OFF In a matchup against the Miami Dolphins, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo was carted to the locker room with an ankle injury after their opening drive. 
Labeled as questionable to return, if Garoppolo remains out and misses significant time it will have a big impact on the NFC West race. 
For the Seahawks, who currently find themselves on the outside looking in of the playoffs, the 49ers being forced to rely on rookie quarterback Brock Purdy could be a boost that they need to win the division.
NOV 30 RUSS LOSES IT Russell Wilson has the trade he wanted and he has a $250 million contract.
What he does not have with the 3-8 Denver Broncos? The locker room.
“Russ has lost some people around that team. He has lost some people in that locker room,"" NFL Network insider Tom Pelissero reports.
It's worth noting that Pelissero isn't in the business of gossip, nor is he ""anti-Wilson.'' That makes this a real problem for Wilson - who has just eight touchdowns and five interceptions through 10 games this season - and for the Broncos, who gave up a gold mine in trade but team has now lost each of its last three games.
NOV 26 TREADWELL ELEVATED
Looking for additional wide receiver depth, the Seattle Seahawks have elevated former Jaguars and Vikings pass catcher Laquon Treadwell to the active roster. 
Last season in Jacksonville, Treadwell has 33 catches on 51 targets for 434 yards and a touchdown in 12 games, with seven starts. 
NOV 20 DK FINED Seahawks wide receiver DK Metcalf has been fined $29,785 by the NFL for ""unsportsmanlike conduct'' penalty in last week's loss to the Bucs in Germany.
Metcalf was flagged in that game for ""arguing with an official'' (if you could call it that) over an uncalled defensive pass interference penalty in the end zone.
Metcalf finished with a team high 71 receiving yards on six catches. ... and now during the team's bye has to cough up almost $30,000 for a finger-point.
NOV 9 'NEVER MORE WRONG' The At least Curt Menefee is admitting it.
“I’m not afraid to say I don’t think I’ve ever been more wrong about a team coming out of training camp than I was this Seahawks team,” Menefee told Seattle Sports’ Brock and Salk on Tuesday.
The Seahawks are 6-3 and Menefee, host of ""FOX NFL Sunday'' and the Seahawks preseason TV play-by-play announcer, said he thought they might be lucky to win six games total.
Menefee specifically mentioned coach Pete Carroll, saying ""He was excited about this team'' at camp and that maybe we all should have picked up on that. And he mentioned Geno Smith, a surprise MVP candidate.
“I’m happy for him, I genuinely am because I think it’s a great comeback story,” Menefee said of the QB.
NOVEMBER 1 SEAHAWKS WAIVE SIDNEY JONES 
The Seattle Seahawks have waived veteran cornerback Sidney Jones, after the conclusion of Tuesday's NFL Trade Deadline. 
The Seahawks had attempted to move Jones before the deadline, but were unable to do so. 
In two seasons with the Seahawks, Jones played in 19 games, starting 11, with 66 tackles, and 10 pass deflections. 
OCTOBER 25 SEAHAWKS RELEASE TWO FROM PRACTICE SQUAD
The Seattle Seahawks announced Tuesday that they have released running back Godwin Igwebuike and linebacker Christian Jones from the practice squad. 
Igwebuike emerged as an underrated depth piece at running back for the Detroit Lions. Last season, he rushed 18 times for 118 yards and a touchdown while catching seven passes for 60 yards. 
Jones appeared in three games this season after three elevations from the practice squad. 
OCTOBER 20 STAR RB HEADING TO NFC WEST
The Carolina Panthers have found a trade partner for star running back, Christian McCaffrey - the San Francisco 49ers. 
According to multiple reports, the Panthers will be sending McCaffrey to the Seahawks' NFC West rivals in exchange for multiple second-day picks. 
The Rams and Bills were also said to be in the running for McCaffrey
Just last week against the Rams, McCaffrey had 158 yards from scrimmage in 20 total touches. And for the season, the Stanford product has 670 yards from scrimmage on 118 touches, with three touchdowns, in an otherwise anemic offense. 
OCT 19 PRACTICE SQUAD MOVES The Seahawks made two practice squad moves on Wednesday. Seattle signed former WSU standout WR Easop Winston to their practice squad and released Kevin Kassis to make room for Winston.
Winston caught 137 balls for 1,624 yards and 19 touchdowns for the Cougars over 26 games and spent time with the Rams and Saints before arriving in Seattle.
OCT 18 SEATTLE SIGNING The Seahawks on Tuesday had in for a visit veteran defensive tackle Vernon Butler and provided workouts to Notre Dame QB Jack Coan,  receivers Dai'Jean Dixon, Dazz Newsome and Easop Winston (of Washington State) and have decided to sign Winston to the practice squad.
OCT 17 NFC WEST TRADE
The Arizona Cardinals have acquired wide receiver Robbie Anderson from the Carolina Panthers via trade.
Anderson, who played in Los Angeles against the Rams on Sunday, was kicked out of the game by his own head coach, Steve Wilks.
""I was honestly confused,"" Anderson said after the game. ""I wanted to be in the game. I've never had somebody yell to get out of the game. So I was honestly confused and upset by that. I should be. I don't see nobody that is a true competitor, that knows the value they bring and has true passion for the game, that will be OK with being told not to do something or being taken out of something when they didn't do nothing wrong.""
OCT 12 MARINERS/SEAHAWKS GAMEPLAN SET
The contingency plans for the Seattle Seahawks and the Arizona Cardinals' kick-off time have now officially been set. 
In the event that the Seattle Mariners American League Divisional Playoffs Series vs. the Houston Astros goes to four games, the kickoff time will be moved from 1:05 pm PT, to 2:30 PM PT, according to reports. 
Houston currently leads the series 1-0 and could sweep the five-game series by winning the next two games, negating the necessity of the time change. 
Should the Mariners win one of the next two games, the first pitch for Game 4 of their series will be at 1:07 pm PT. 
OCT 10 GAME TIME MOVED?
According to Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll, the Seattle Seahawks are in discussions to move the kickoff time of their Sunday matchup with the Arizona Cardinals, so as not to conflict with Game 4 of the Seattle Mariners MLB Divisional series against the Houston Astros. 
Carroll says Seahawks are discussing all options, should the times' conflict with one another. 
OCT 9 WALKER HOUSE CALL
In relief of his injured teammate Rashaad Penny, Seahawks rookie running back Kenneth Walker has already made a major impact in the game thus far against the Saints, breaking free for a 69-yard touchdown run to give Seattle a brief 32-31 lead in the fourth quarter.
Unfortunately for the Seahawks, the Saints responded with a long Taysom Hill touchdown run of their own on the very next drive, and moved up 39-32 after the two point conversion.
OCT 9 PENNY OUT The Seattle Seahawks are down a running back in their game against the New Orleans Saints as running back Rashaad Penny sustained a lower leg injury in the game and was carted off.
The Seattle Seahawks may be down a running back in their game against the New Orleans Saints today. Running back Rashaad Penny potentially suffered a lower leg injury in the game. He was able to make it to the sideline but had to be helped to the bench by teammates to get checked out by trainers.
Penny had eight carries for 54 yards before getting hurt and now gives way to at least in part the rookie Kenneth Walker III.
OCTOBER 7 SAINTS NAME ANDY DALTON STARTING QB VS. SEAHAWKS
The Seattle Seahawks are set to face Andy Dalton and the New Orleans Saints this weekend after starter Jameis Winston was ruled out for the second straight week with a back and hip injury.
Dalton made his Saints debut last week in London against the Minnesota Vikings. Dalton completed over 70 percent of his passes and threw for 236 yards and a touchdown in a 28-25 loss.
The Saints and Seahawks play at 10 a.m. in New Orleans on Sunday.
OCTOBER 6 ROSTER MOVES 
Seahawks defensive end L.J. Collier (elbow) missed the first four games of the season on IR but has now been designated to return to practice. … opening up a three-week window for his roster return..
Meanwhile, the Seahawks added an old pal to the practice squad, signing center Joey Hunt, and cut DB Quandre Mosely from the practice squad.
SEPTEMBER 28 SEAHAWKS PLACE HOMER ON IR
The Seattle Seahawks have placed running back Travis Homer on IR, following a rib injury he sustained on Sunday against the Falcons. 
To replace Homer, the Seahawks added cornerback Xavier Crawford to the 53-man roster. 
The Seahawks also signed running back Godwin Igwebuike and fullback Cullen Gillaspia to the practice squad.
SEPTEMBER 20 SEAHAWKS SEND CB TO PRACTICE SQUAD
Following their 27-7 blowout loss to the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday, the Seattle Seahawks have sent cornerback Xavier Crawford back to the practice squad. 
Crawford was elevated to the active roster for the matchup with the 49ers.
SEPTEMBER 13 SEAHAWKS ROOKIE RB TO MAKE DEBUT
Per Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll, rookie running back Kenneth Walker III, who missed the team's season-opening win over the Broncos on Monday Night Football this week, will make his NFL debut next Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers. 
“(Walker) is going to be out there this week,” Carroll told 710 ESPN in Seattle.
Before being selected in the second round by Seattle, Walker was a Heisman finalist last season with the Michigan State Spartans, rushing for 1,636 yards on the year.
SEPTEMBER 12 SEAHAWKS SEND ROBINSON TO IR, SIGN TWO FROM PRACTICE SQUAD
Just hours ahead of their Monday Night Football season opener, the Seahawks have made multiple transactions, sending outside linebacker Alton Robinson to injured reserve, keeping him out for at least four games. 
Robinson injured his knee in the preseason finale. To replace Robinson, Seattle elevated practice squad linebacker Tanner Muse.
The Seahawks have also ruled out deep snapper Tyler Ott with a shoulder injury, elevating Carson Tinker to take his place.
AUG 31 UPDATE
The Seahawks, along with the Dallas Cowboys, made a recent call to the New York Jets about disgruntled receiver Denzel Mims. 
How much does Seattle need more receiver help? That's a subject for debate.
How much does Seattle want to give up for Mims? Our guys at CowboysSI.com have the details on what the Cowboys - and the Seahawks - said ""no'' to.
AUGUST 30 CUTS BEGIN
9:15 AM: According to Brady Henderson, the Seahawks have informed center Dakoda Shepley he's being waived. The former CFL star joined the team as a waiver pickup last August after being released by the 49ers and appeared in all three preseason games seeing snaps behind Austin Blythe and Kyle Fuller.
 10:20 AM: Despite a strong preseason showing, per Doug Kyed of PFF and confirmed through a team source, the Seahawks will release undrafted rookie safety Scott Nelson. The former Wisconsin standout produced six tackles and allowed only one catch for seven yards on 73 defensive snaps in exhibition play and could be a priority candidate to re-sign on practice squad as insurance at the safety position.
10:45 AM: According to Henderson, due to a crowded group ahead of him, the Seahawks have informed tight end Tyler Mabry of his release. The team also cut ties with former Washington receiver Aaron Fuller.
10:47 AM: After finishing third on the team among receivers in receptions and receiving yards a year ago, the Seahawks are officially moving on from veteran wideout Freddie Swain. The 2020 sixth-round pick played his way out of a roster spot this month, struggling with drops during the preseason and falling down the depth chart during training camp behind the likes of rookie Dareke Young and Penny Hart.
11:01 AM: Per Tom Pelissero of NFL Network, the Seahawks have released linebacker Tanner Muse. The ex-Clemson safety appeared in six games last season, producing four tackles on special teams.
11:24 AM: Moving on from a former top pick, ESPN's Jeremy Fowler reports the Seahawks have informed safety Marquise Blair of his release. Coming off of two injury-shortened seasons, the fourth-year defender started training camp working at nickel cornerback before transitioning back to safety full-time and struggled with tackling throughout the preseason. Passed on the depth chart by Josh Jones, he became expendable in a crowded position group also featuring Jamal Adams, Quandre Diggs, and Ryan Neal.
8:48 AM: With Trey Lance set to take over under center, the 49ers have a potentially expensive decision awaiting them on veteran quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo. If the team releases him before Tuesday's deadline, they would save $25.5 million in cap space. But according to insider Jordan Schultz, general manager John Lynch isn't keen on the idea of Garoppolo ending up with the Seahawks, who play their division rivals in Week 2 and could have interest in upgrading at the position if he becomes available to sign. This will be a situation worth monitoring over the next 24 hours.
2:22 PM: Garoppolo won't be coming to Seattle. Per ESPN's Adam Schefter, the veteran quarterback agreed to a restructured one-year contract to stay in San Francisco that includes a no-trade clause, which surely would eliminate the possibility of being dealt to a division rival.
Garoppolo and the Niners have a new deal agreed that is worth $6.5 million in fully guaranteed base salary, a reduction of about $19 million from his previous salary.
11:05 AM: In the first announced cut, Pro Football Network's Aaron Wilson reported Seattle has waived undrafted rookie Cade Brewer for the second time in less than two weeks. The former Texas standout signed with the Seahawks after the draft and caught three passes for 17 yards in three exhibition games.
11:29 AM: Per Brady Henderson of ESPN, the Seahawks have waived cornerback Jameson Houston. Originally signed on August 10, he appeared in all three preseason games, registering five tackles.
1:16 PM: Along with confirming Houston and Brewer had been cut, the Seahawks announced cornerback Tre Brown (knee) has been transferred to the reserve/PUP list, which means he will miss at least the first four regular season games. The second-year defender missed all of training camp and continues to recover from a patellar tendon injury suffered in Week 11 last season.
In addition, Seattle waived linebacker Aaron Donkor and running back Ronnie Rivers, bringing the roster to 76 players. Donkor, who joined the team through the International Player Pathway Program in 2021, appeared in one preseason game before being sidelined by a hamstring injury, while Rivers played in the final preseason game after being signed last week.

https://www.si.com/nfl/seahawks/news/daviyon-nixon-signs-seattle-seahawks-defensive-line-depth,"Seahawks Sign DT Daviyon Nixon, Bolster Defensive Line Depth","Previously starring at Iowa, Daviyon Nixon hasn't done much in two seasons with the Carolina Panthers. But the defensive line-needy Seattle Seahawks hope to unearth some of the athletic defender's untapped potential amid a playoff run.
After losing defensive tackle Bryan Mone to a season-ending knee injury last week, the Seahawks have added defensive line reinforcements for the final stretch run.
According to Field Yates of ESPN, Seattle has signed free agent defensive tackle Daviyon Nixon, who recently was waived by Carolina. In a corresponding move to make room on the 53-man roster, the team cut reserve running back Tony Jones Jr.
Turning in a stellar collegiate career at Iowa, Nixon racked up 74 tackles, 8.5 sacks, and 19 tackles for loss in two seasons with the Hawkeyes. Displaying rare athleticism for a 300-plus pound defensive tackle, he also returned an interception 71 yards for a touchdown as a junior, helping him earn First-Team All-American honors in 2020 before opting to declare for the NFL Draft.
During the pre-draft process, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Nixon posted a 4.90-second 40-yard dash at 313 pounds. He also reportedly ran a respectable 4.70 short shuttle, exhibiting speed and quickness rarely found at his position.
Despite the impressive testing, however, Nixon surprisingly didn't hear his name called in the draft until the Panthers stopped his free fall by selecting him 158th overall in the fifth round. Struggling to find a consistent spot in the team's defensive line rotation, his rookie season ended after just seven games due to a knee injury and he finished with just nine tackles and a partial sack in limited playing time.
Fully recovered from his injury in time for training camp, Nixon produced three tackles in exhibition play and Carolina cut him during final roster cuts in September, promptly re-signing him to the practice squad once he cleared waivers. Logging only 62 defensive snaps in seven games, the organization moved on from him on December 13.
After failing to stick with the Panthers, with Mone done for the year and veteran Al Woods ailing, the Seahawks hope to unlock some of Nixon's untapped potential as a 3-tech defensive tackle in their hybrid 3-4 defense. If there's reason to believe he may be able to turn the corner with a change of scenery, Pro Football Focus did give him a 75.8 pass rushing grade as a rookie, suggesting he flashed in limited opportunities.
If Nixon can return to college form and inflict some damage penetrating gaps with his elite quickness off the snap, he could wind up being more than a late season rental for Seattle and play his way into future plans. Of course, it's also possible his lack of success in Carolina wasn't a fluke and he will have to earn a spot rotating with Shelby Harris, Poona Ford, Quinton Jefferson, L.J. Collier, and Myles Adams.
The decision to cut Jones, who was signed as a free agent in October and played in four games with the Seahawks, suggests starter Ken Walker III should be in good shape despite sitting out Tuesday's practice with a lingering ankle issue. Currently, the team has Walker, Travis Homer, and DeeJay Dallas on the 53-man roster and re-signed Wayne Gallman to the practice squad as insurance.
