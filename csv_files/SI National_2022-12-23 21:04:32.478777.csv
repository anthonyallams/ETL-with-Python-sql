Lakers big man Anthony Davis is dealing with a “stress injury” in his right foot and will remain out indefinitely, the team announced on Friday.
The update is the first official one to come from the Lakers after various reports indicated that Davis was poised to miss at least a month with a foot injury that he suffered last Friday during a game against the Nuggets. Initial reports indicated that there was no clear return timeline for the 29-year-old, which the team confirmed in Friday’s announcement. 
However, shortly after the team’s release, ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reported that the pain in Davis’s injured foot has subsided. He reportedly plans to rest it for another seven-to-10 days before having it re-evaluated to see if he can return to the court.
Davis will miss his fourth straight game Friday when the Lakers take on the Hornets. 
Davis did not return in the second half of last Friday night’s win over the Nuggets after he appeared to tweak his right foot during a collision with Nikola Jokić in the first quarter. ESPN’s Dave McMenamin reported that the Lakers big man was experiencing discomfort in his foot, but there was hope within the organization that he avoided a severe injury.
Davis finished the game with 10 points on 4-for-7 shooting, four rebounds and two assists in 17 minutes.
Davis had been mostly healthy to begin the 2022–23 season after having missed more than half of the Lakers’ regular-season games over the past two years. In 25 games played this season, the 29-year-old had been extremely effective as well, racking up 27.4 points, 12.1 rebounds and 2.1 blocks per contest. 
Despite Davis’s output, Los Angeles has once again struggled to string together wins, posting a 13–18 record thus far this season. Following a matchup with the Hornets Friday, the Lakers will look to get back on track on Christmas Day against Luka Dončić and the Mavericks.",Sports Illustrated,"Nba, Breaking, Wire",Zach koons,"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 20:37:03 GMT",The star big man will remain out indefinitely.,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NjUzOTk0NDI4MTQ2ODUw/anthony-davis-1.jpg
https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/12/23/rob-gronkowski-tampa-bay-buccaneers-todd-bowles-reached-out-return-unretirement,Bucs’ Todd Bowles Said Gronk Reached Out to Team Recently,"The former tight end retired for the second time in the Summer.
In the offseason, for the second time, tight end Rob Gronkowski retired from the NFL. And a few weeks ago, for the second time, Gronkowski considered coming out of retirement.
Buccaneers head coach Todd Bowles revealed that Gronkowski called the team about a possible return for the playoff push. However, nothing serious came of the call. 
“It was more of a conversation than anything else,” Bowles said, via the Tampa Bay Times’ Rick Stroud. “Usually, when you have to think about playing, you probably don’t want to play. When it’s just a discussion, I didn’t think much of it at the time.”
NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo reports Gronkowski has actually spoken to the Buccaneers multiple times this year, and this conversation was just the latest instance. Garafolo added that this could indicate that returning in 2023 is “in play” for the tight end.
The former tight end originally stepped away from football in 2019, but returned in 2020 when he followed Tom Brady to Tampa Bay. After two years with the Buccaneers, Gronkowski once again retired in July, seemingly for good this time.
On Wednesday, however, Gronkowski tweeted that he was “bored,” something that caused speculation as to whether he was ready to make a return to the league. Since then, the tight end said two teams reached out with potential interest in bringing him aboard, with one team utilizing a unique recruiting pitch.
Despite the consideration, Gronkowski said he is staying retired for now.

https://www.si.com/college/2022/12/23/football-case-mike-leach-hall-of-fame-induction,Football World Advocates for Mike Leach’s Inclusion in the Hall of Fame,"Some say the stringent Hall of Fame standards should be relaxed for the legendary Mississippi State coach.
Four-hundredths of a percentage point should not keep Mike Leach out of the College Football Hall of Fame, says National Football Foundation chair Archie Manning.
“I think Mike will be in the Hall of Fame, but it’ll be up to the Honor’s Committee,” Manning says.
Leach, the former Mississippi State, Washington State and Texas Tech coach who died on Dec. 12, does not meet the standard for a coach to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. Induction requirements for coaches include (1) 10 years of head coaching experience, (2) 100 victories and (3) a winning percentage of 60 percent. Leach’s tenure ended with a winning mark of 59.6%. 
However, Leach’s case is a unique situation, says Steve Hatchell, the president and CEO of the NFF, which operates the Hall of Fame. Leach’s impact on the game went beyond the field as he is heralded as one of the most important innovators of offensive football, revolutionizing the sport with the Air Raid offense.
Leach passed at the age of 61 and had planned to continue coaching despite battling severe pneumonia-like conditions this past season. He died of heart failure.
“Where the difference comes in here is that Mike was a young man and he passed away,” Hatchell says. “The fact that he passed away brings a different perspective on this. Everybody would say he’d continue to coach and continue to win.
“I’m positive the NFF will do the right thing.”
Since Hatchell took over at NFF in 2005, the organization has been notably stringent on its coaching induction requirements–a purposeful mission to protect the sanctity of the Hall of Fame. Over the years, administrators and coaches have expressed to Hatchell that the Hall continues to be “very strong” on the requirements, he says.
But both Hatchell and Manning believe that Leach’s circumstance could call for an exception.
“It’s different with Mike,” Hatchell says. “There was something special about him. There isn't an organization that thinks more of Mike than ours. To say we thought the world of Mike Leach is putting it mildly. We have great respect for him. This goes way beyond the coach. He was a smart and shrewd guy with great insight on a lot of things.”
Says Manning: “I don’t think minor percentage points should be a problem.”The only question should be when he’s inducted and not if he’s inducted, Manning says.
 The Hall of Fame’s 2023 class has already been selected and will be announced in January. According to Hall of Fame requirements, coaches are not to be inducted until three years have passed since their retirement. Manning says Leach may be treated differently since he died as an active coach, a somewhat rare occurrence. The last sitting SEC head coach to die was Bo Rein, who was killed in a plane crash a couple of months into his tenure at LSU. The last active FBS coach to die was Northwestern’s Randy Walker in 2006.
The 2024 class will be selected next fall through an elaborate nominating and voting process. Hatchell expects all three schools at which Leach coached to nominate the coach for the Hall. Nominees are sent to nine district screening committees spread across the country. They narrow the group to about 75. Those are placed on the national ballot and voted on by all dues-paying NFF chapter members, NFF academic members and Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) members.
The results are compiled and provided to the Honor’s Court, which determines the final class members. The Honor’s Court includes coaches, media and administrators. The target each year is to induct about 12 players and two coaches, Hatchell says.
The Hall of Fame induction process can get controversial. Several coaches and their families and fans have mounted campaigns through the years to get an induction, most notably Howard Schnellenberger, the former Miami, FAU and Louisville coach who won a national title with the Hurricanes. Schnellenberger finished with a winning mark of 50.6%.
Since Leach’s death, there’s been a loud outcry from media, fans and even coaches to include Leach in the Hall of Fame despite his winning percentage. During a memorial for the coach in Starkville, Miss. earlier this week, Gary O’Hagan, Leach’s former agent and longtime friend, spent several minutes of his speech on the Hall of Fame issue.
“Mike Leach was unique and valuable to the sport,” O’Hagan says. “It’s not that Mike needs any special treatment. It’s that those in the Hall of Fame want Mike to be in the club with them.”
The issue is of importance to his former school. Mississippi State plays Illinois in the Reliaquest Bowl on Jan. 2. Mississippi State officials have discussed counting a potential bowl victory for both coach Zach Arnett and Leach.
There are other ways Leach could get closer to 60%. For example, Texas Tech fired Leach a day before the Red Raiders beat Michigan State after the 2009 season. The victory did not count toward Leach’s record.",Sports Illustrated,"Hp feature, College",Ross dellenger,"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 19:41:32 GMT",Some say the stringent Hall of Fame standards should be relaxed for the legendary Mississippi State coach.,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NjUyODM4Mjc2NjM3ODU4/mikeleachhof.jpg
https://www.si.com/betting/2022/12/23/grizzlies-warriors-bets-picks-odds-nba-christmas,"Grizzlies vs. Warriors Odds, Bets, Picks: Memphis Will Run up The Score on Christmas","Even without Steph Curry the matchup between the Grizzlies and Warriors on Christmas is a must watch game. Kyle Wood shares his predictions and best bet.
This is a matchup months in the making. The Grizzlies-Warriors rivalry dates back to their 2022 six-game, second-round battle, which Golden State won.
There’s been no shortage of back and forth-between the sides since.
Ja Morant and Draymond Green both tweeted about the seemingly inevitable Christmas Day rematch over the summer with Green reminding Morant “the champs play at home.” That ended up being the case when the schedule was released.
With Finals MVP Steph Curry (shoulder) in street clothes, Memphis is a road favorite in the first of four Grizzlies-Warriors games this season. Golden State has slipped out of a play-in spot entirely without Curry for the last week and a half and Andrew Wiggins (groin) out since the beginning of December.
The Grizzlies could get Desmond Bane (toe) back this weekend as he was upgraded to questionable for Friday’s game against the Suns. The Warriors have a long layoff from their last game Wednesday against the Nets to Sunday’s showcase. They also have the added advantage of playing at the Chase Center, where they are 12–2 compared to 3–16 on the road.

Memphis lost its last two after beginning the month with seven wins in a row. The loss to Oklahoma City came with Morant out for the second half after an early ejection and the Grizzlies dropped their second game of a four-game road trip Tuesday in Denver, despite Morant’s 35 points.
Getting Bane back in the lineup would be huge for coach Taylor Jenkins, who has yet to have his entire starting five available this season. Even without Bane, who was averaging nearly 25 ppg on 45% shooting from deep, Memphis is 11th in offensive rating and fifth in defensive rating. 
The Grizzlies are the No. 1 rebounding team in the league and if Jaren Jackson Jr. had played enough games to be qualified, he would be leading the NBA in blocks per game by a wide margin. Though Golden State won the playoff matchup, Memphis took the season series, 3–1, last year and all but one of those games were decided by single digits.
Kyle Terada/USA TODAY Sports
Jordan Pooleis the Warriors’ leading scorer at 19.1 ppg with Curry and Wiggins out. Even before one of the team’s top wing defenders and the two-time MVP went out, the Dubs were falling well short of championship-level basketball. They ranked 13th in offensive rating and 25th in defensive rating. They do lead the NBA in three-pointers made per game (16.2), though Curry accounts for about a third of that production.
Kevon Looney will have his hands full inside trying to battle with the Memphis big men inside for rebounds and Poole and Klay Thompson will have to deal with a rotating cast of talented wing defenders with a larger-than-usual offensive load on the two of them.
Even considering Golden State’s record at home, a 1–6 mark without Curry and back-to-back 30-plus-point losses in New York heading into this matchup makes Memphis an easy pick to cover. The Warriors got up to beat the Celtics a few weeks ago, but that was with Curry in the lineup. This is an opportunity for the fully healthy Grizzlies to score a convincing win on national television against the severely shorthanded Warriors after months to sit with that defeat in the playoffs. I think they capitalize on it, and run up the score a bit in the process.

Arch Manning’s recruitment process over the past few years was heavily publicized, resulting in the quarterback choosing to attend Texas in 2023. Many teams were in on Manning, but coach Steve Sarkisian and the Longhorns program landed the top recruit.
Earlier this year, Cooper Manning said his son took control of his own recruitment process, which means that Arch was the driving force behind making the decision. And, in an interview with Sports Illustrated‘s Ross Dellenger, Archie Manning explained his grandson’s decision even further.
Archie explained that Arch and Sarkisian hit it off the moment they first met.
“You could say that Sark was his first love,” Archie said. “He started talking to Sark on Zoom calls when Sark was at Alabama. Kirby [Smart] and coach [Nick] Saban recruited him hard. They checked every box in Arch’s mind.”
Schools started recruiting Arch when he was in middle school, but Arch really first started looking at schools in 2020, when Sarkisian was still the offensive coordinator at Alabama. Once he took the job at Texas, Sarkisian used the relationship he had with Arch to bring him over to Austin.
Besides Texas, Archie said that Arch also considered Alabama and Georgia, and “it was hard for him to say no” to those two schools. In total, Arch made 20 college visits, 12 of which were to those three schools.

San Francisco will be the site of a family reunion in 2023 after the Giants agreed to sign left-handed reliever Taylor Rogers to a three-year deal worth $33 million, according to MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand.
Rogers will now join his twin brother Tyler, who has pitched for the Giants since 2019, in the Bay Area. 
The Rogers brother will be just the fourth set of twins in MLB history to link up on the same team, according to MLB’s Sarah Langs. Previous pairs have included José and Ozzie Canseco in Oakland, Eddie and Johnny O’Brien in Pittsburgh and Joe and Red Shannon with the Boston Braves. 
Though being on the same team is already a rare enough occurrence, the Rogers brothers will have a chance to become just the second set of twins to appear in the same MLB game for the same team, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The twins previously pitched in the same game this past April, but were on different teams–Taylor with the Padres and Tyler with the Giants.
Taylor Rogers, 32, was traded twice in 2022. Before the season, he was dealt from the Twins to the Padres but was then shipped from San Diego to Milwaukee in August as a part of the Josh Hader trade. 
Rogers finished the season with a career-high 31 saves in 66 outings. However, his ERA also vaulted to a career-high 4.76, which included a 5.48 mark in 24 appearances with Milwaukee.
Though the end of the 2022 campaign may not have been up to par, Rogers is just a season removed from being an American League All-Star with the Twins. During his first six seasons in Minnesota, he posted a 3.15 ERA in 319 appearance, a mark he’ll surely look to replicate alongside his brother in San Francisco. ",Sports Illustrated,"Extra mustard, Breaking, Wire",Zach koons,"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 19:19:48 GMT",San Francisco will be the site of a family reunion in 2023.,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NjUyNjg3MTQ3NDc2NTA0/taylor-rogers.jpg
https://www.si.com/mma/2022/12/23/russian-ukrainian-fighters-ongoing-war-difficult-position,Ongoing War Puts Russian and Ukrainian Fighters in a Difficult Position,"A touchy topic for both sides, sports and politics collide in the world of MMA.

View the original article to see embedded media.

Nine days before Islam Makhachev defeated Charles Oliveira for the lightweight title at UFC 280 in October, he conducted a series of interviews concerning the fight.
Makhachev answered questions about the upcoming fight with relative ease, including ones about his home in the Russian republic of Dagestan. During one particular media call, he was asked for his opinion on the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, a war where Ukrainian MMA fighter Yaroslav Amosov served. Instead of offering insight, he ended the call.
The question was valid, yet so was Makhachev’s decision not to answer. It is a question with no proper reply. If he supports his native Russia, then he is criticized throughout America. But if he criticizes the war, then that has the potential to create a whole new batch of problems. So why not just avoid the question?
“Many Russian fighters are afraid to talk about it,” says Amosov, speaking through a translator. “And many are zombified by their propaganda.”
Amosov is the reigning Bellator welterweight champion. Undefeated in the cage, he has won all 26 of his fights. But he encountered loss in an altogether different manner earlier this year when protecting Ukraine as a member of its armed forces.
A champion leaving his sport to fight in a war is just one example of how the war in Ukraine has significantly impacted the fight world. As Christmas approaches, there is no end in sight.
“War is bad for everyone, but people should ask, where is the war taking place, and who started it?” says Amosov. “If someone told me we were going to invade someone else’s land, I wouldn’t have gone.”
Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, and the war has caused tens of thousands of deaths and Europe’s largest refugee plight since World War II. There is plenty of shared history between the two nations, and Ukraine was formerly under Russian control until the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991. It appears this current war is a strategic plan to obliterate the modern-day state of Ukraine and replace it under Russian control. And with a plethora of Russian and Ukrainian fighters in every major MMA organization, the war has affected fighters.
Nearly a dozen Russian fighters were asked about the war, but all offered similar answers.
Speaking through a translator, UFC star Petr Yan said, “I just keep doing my job being an athlete. Sports should be without politics. I hope that everything comes back to normal.”
Askar Askarov, a former UFC flyweight, also spoke through a translator, stating, “I’m just doing my job and training hard. I’m not focused on anything else.”
Bellator’s Vadim Nemkov said, through translation, “Keep sports out of politics.” Reigning Bellator lightweight champ Usman Nurmagomedov was asked the question, but his translator responded that there would not be an answer.
The pattern is clear. The potential for negative consequences exists for those willing to speak out against Russia. One fighter refused to speak on the record because his mother was scheduled for surgery in Russia, and he refused to make any comment that could put her in the slightest bit of danger.
“The culture [in Russia and Ukraine] is very, very different from America,” said UFC heavyweight Alexey Oleinik. He was born in Kharkiv when it was part of the Soviet Union, but it is now part of the sovereign nation of Ukraine. Oleinik fights out of Moscow, Russia, and he also believes–you guessed it–that sports should be separate from politics.
“I am not a political analyst, I am a fighter,” says Oleinik. “I am not a blogger, I do not want to speak about it on social media.”
Russia is part of both Europe and Asia, and a noticeable difference from the United States is criticizing public figures. That is a way of life in the U.S., but it is much different in Russia.
“This is tough to explain,” says Oleinik. “But only people who live in these countries, only those people can judge what is happening in Russia and Ukraine. No one from the outside. No citizens from other countries can speak on this.
“I hope it is finished soon. Russia and Ukraine, it is one people and one nation, so it is very terrible.”
The war has affected the fighters in different ways. The Russian fighters have, predominantly, remained quiet. For the fighters from Ukraine, it is a terrible strain to know what is occurring back home. A complicating factor is that so many Russian and Ukrainian train and spar together.
When it comes to the war, the stage has been set for the fighters. There are no ramifications or repercussions for those who remain quiet. That is a dangerous blueprint, however, as history has repeatedly taught that silence is as loud as thunder.
Drew Dober jumped into the lightweight rankings following his win this Saturday against Bobby Green. Dober endured a significant amount of punishment from Green in the first round, then unleashed a vicious assault in the second round
Dober called out Michael Chandler and Jalin Turner for a fight, which both could be a banger. The fight against Turner would also have some unique optics, pitting the 6’3” Turner against the 5’8” Dober. Turner is ranked tenth in the division, so that fight would represent Dober’s shot at cracking the top 10.
Another interesting option for Dober is Paddy Pimblett. There are few secrets in MMA, and it is painfully obvious why people are lining up to face Pimblett after so many of his flaws were exposed in his bout against Jared Gordon at UFC 282. Initially, I thought Ilia Topuria was going to be the one to wreck Pimblett’s hype train, but Topuria is on a different path after dominating Bryce Mitchell. Dober would benefit from fighting Pimblett, as would anyone else in the top 15.
I’ve always thought of the Internet as the Wild West. There are countless different options to read or watch anything. If you’re clicking on these stories, I am grateful. And a special shoutout to those who email and engage, which is really fun.
There will be plenty more coverage next week. That includes the Top 10 fighters for 2022, the fights to watch for in 2023, and my chance to play Nostradamus and predict what’s to unfold in the coming year.

https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/12/23/giants-free-agents-aaron-judge-carlos-correa-trevor-bauer-dodgers-rickey-henderson-birthday,A Giant Disappointment,"At 11:50 a.m. ET Wednesday, less than 10 hours after news broke that Carlos Correa and the Mets had agreed to a 12-year, $315 million contract, I texted my friend Connor two sentences: “Wellness check. You alive?”
Connor is a Giants fan, and, well, as you know by now, it’s been a rough week for his favorite team. Actually, it’s been a rough month. The Giants backed out of their 13-year, $350 million agreement with Correa after reviewing his medical information. As Correa’s agent Scott Boras told Tom Verducci, “something in his [medical] history that for whatever reason gave them doubts” about closing their deal with the marquee shortstop. Boras then reopened free-agent negotiations and the Mets swooped in and signed Correa, who will be their starting third baseman because they already have Francisco Lindor at short.
Troy Taormina/USA TODAY Sports (left), Thomas Shea/USA TODAY Sports (right)
This was the second time in two weeks that the Giants appeared to have secured a superstar free agent, only to lose him to a New York team. The first one came fourteen days earlier, when the New York Post’s Jon Heyman erroneously reported on Twitter that “Arson Judge appears headed to Giants.” The hilarious typo wasn’t the only error. The next morning Aaron Judge agreed to re-sign with the Yankees for nine years and $360 million, the same offer the Giants reportedly had extended.
So you can understand why Connor, and most Giants fans for that matter, were angry. “I am completely embarrassed to be associated with this team,” he responded. This was the first of seven straight messages he sent me. The next six read:
“They’re begging to give out a third of a billion dollars and can’t get anyone to take it.”
“And to get bamboozled by the f---ing New York Mets?”
“I know what they are now. But they are the Mets.”
“The optics are horrendous.”
“Imagine trying to sign a future star free agent? Or another Boras client? They’re completely f---ed.”
“If they weren’t being used before to drive up prices, that’s exactly what they’ll be now. It’s sad. It’s pathetic. It’s inexplicable.”
First, these texts are hilarious. I am still laughing at the image of Giants owner Greg Johnson standing in Haight-Ashbury “begging to give out a third of a billion dollars” to random passersby, only for them to turn him down. Hyperbole aside, though, Connor was right. 
The optics were horrendous, even before most of the details came out. Things looked worse with each new story. As Verducci reported Wednesday afternoon, Correa was in San Francisco and dressed for his press conference on Tuesday morning when his deal fell through. Naturally, Giants fans interpreted this as their team leaving the superstar at the altar. ESPN’s Jeff Passan reported yesterday the injury that so concerned the Giants happened while Correa was still in the minor leagues; he broke his right fibula and needed surgery in 2014, but this hasn’t been a problem at any point during his MLB career. Another thing that surfaced: Correa went house shopping in the Bay Area on Monday after getting his physical, according to Ron Kroichick of the San Francisco Chronicle. 
We probably will never know exactly what happened or why things turned out this way. The Giants have been quiet about why the right lower leg injury so concerned them; because Correa’s deal with the Mets is still pending a physical, San Francisco cannot publicly disclose any information about a free agent that would suppress his value in free agency—even though everything that unfolded did have that effect, albeit only slightly. On behalf of his client, Boras is incentivized to make it seem like there is nothing wrong with Correa. Anything the Mets say about this, assuming their agreement with Correa becomes official after the physical, is likely to support their new third baseman. No independent medical experts are going to examine the health records, and if they do, they cannot talk about it publicly without Correa’s consent—and why would he give his O.K. if the Giants had good reason to renege on the deal.
This is the type of situation that’s ripe for conspiracy. Just look at all the quote tweets of Emma Baccellieri from when she shared Verducci’s story from Wednesday on Twitter. Many of them are more deranged than the texts Connor sent me. I won’t get into any of those theories here, because really, they don’t actually matter. No explanation can change the fact that San Francisco’s entire offseason is one, ahem, giant failure.
The Giants made clear at the beginning of the offseason that they needed to add thump to their lineup. Perhaps they weren’t “begging to give out a third of a billion dollars,” but they said they were willing to pay whatever it takes to sign at least one of the top free agents.
Then, they missed out on Judge, which is fine because everything we know now indicates that he always wanted to re-sign with the Yankees. Maybe he used San Francisco as leverage, but you can’t fault the club for trying to sign the best available free agent, who grew up a Giants fan. There were still plenty of star players available to sign.
And that’s what the Giants did, at least at first. They received glowing reviews for signing Correa because, well, how could they not.
Now, of course, we know they weren’t willing to pay whatever would take to add one of the top free agents, because no matter the reason, in the end, they weren’t willing to execute the letter of agreement with Correa. We don’t know whether this will hinder their ability to sign future top free agents, but it probably won’t help. The optics, indeed, are horrendous.
It’s sad. It’s pathetic. It’s inexplicable.
This morning while I was finishing writing this newsletter, the Giants reportedly agreed to a two-year, $36 million contract with Michael Conforto, who missed all of last season after having shoulder surgery. The deal, which was first reported by Bob Nightengale of USA Today, includes an opt out. A little while later, The Athletic’s Ken Rosenthal reported that San Francisco and lefty reliever Taylor Rogers agreed to a three-year, $33 million deal.
These are good, smart moves that make the Giants better, but it is still deeply hilarious that they were comfortable signing Conforto and Mitch Haniger, who due to injury combined to play 57 games in 2022, while Correa played in 136 games—more than twice as many.
Here is Connor’s takeaway, if you're curious: “The risk tolerance, ironically enough, must be incredibly low for this front office. Damningly low.”

“The Dodgers have 14 days to decide how they will handle Trevor Bauer—whether they will cut the pitcher, who has just been reinstated from the longest suspension for domestic violence in league history, or whether they will continue to roster him.”
That's how Emma Baccellieri begins her column following the news, which was first reported by Stephanie Apstein, that Bauer’s suspension was reduced from 324 games to 194 games, time which he has already served. Bauer is eligible to pitch in 2023, but that doesn’t mean that he should. 
As Emma writes, “To roster Bauer would be to make an explicit statement about the club’s values and perspective. To cut him would do the same, a statement equal in magnitude, opposite in direction. The clock is now ticking on the Dodgers’ choice. And if it takes them 14 days, well, that makes a statement all its own.”

It wasn’t long ago that the collective baseball world was wringing its hands over the stagnant nature of MLB’s hot stove. It was less than four years ago when, heading into the 2019 season, it took until February for Manny Machado to sign with the Padres. Bryce Harper didn’t sign his deal with the Phillies until March, which meant a long, cold winter waiting for the blockbusters to come through.
It’s not even Christmas yet, and the narrative has completely flipped. As of the writing of this newsletter, about 80% of our top 50 free agents heading into the offseason have signed new deals, including all of the top 15. The ones still available are pitching-centric, led by our No. 16 free agent, Nathan Eovaldi. Given the Carlos Correa saga from this past week, though, nothing is a given, and there are still plenty of moves to be made that will impact the season to come. In the meantime, though, let’s enjoy the offseason-as-spectacle alongside our respective holiday celebrations
Previous Question: Aaron Judge was one of four free agents this offseason who have won both the MVP and Rookie of the Year award in their careers. Who are the other three? 
Answer: Justin Verlander (Mets), Cody Bellinger (Cubs) and José Abreu (Astros)
Question: Five active second basemen have hit at least 100 home runs in their careers. One of them is Robinson Canó, who is technically still active because he hasn’t retired. Who are the other four? 
(For this question, a player must have played at least 50% of his games at second base to qualify, so you will not find Marcus Semien or Javier Báez on this list.)

Happy early birthday to Rickey Henderson! He turns 64 on Christmas, and while there’s any number of statistics to demonstrate just how incredible he was, here’s one that particularly struck me: Henderson stole more than 50 bases each season from 1980 to ’86. That’s seven consecutive seasons of 50-plus SB, a standard so unthinkable for modern baseball that you have to completely shift the parameters of your search to find anything mildly, remotely close: In the last 10 seasons, there has been one player with seven non-consecutive seasons of more than 25 stolen bases. (That’s Starling Marte—Trea Turner and Jarrod Dyson are right behind with six such seasons each.) In other words, MLB doesn’t have anyone right now who’s been even half the base-stealer that Henderson was at the start of his career. (Or the middle or, frankly, the end: It’s been over a decade since anyone stole more than 65 bases. Yet Henderson did it at age 39 in ’98.) So a happy birthday to the Man of Steal, and may the new year with its new rules, bigger bases and all, bring us more action on the basepaths.

The Browns and right tackle Jack Conklin have agreed to a four-year, $60 million extension, as first reported by ESPN’s Adam Schefter.
The deal will pay Conklin $31 million guaranteed and keep one of Cleveland’s most-talented lineman in place for the next few seasons. 
Conklin, 28, was scheduled to become a free agent this offseason but is in the midst of another strong season with the Browns. The former first-round pick was previously named an All-Pro with Cleveland in 2020 before he tore his patellar tendon in the middle of the 2021 campaign and missed the back end of the year. 
Now back on the field, Conklin has helped the Browns rank among the top rushing offenses in the NFL. Cleveland is fifth in rushing yards per game through 15 weeks, averaging 149.0 yards per contest behind the efforts of Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt. 
Before joining the Browns in 2020, Conklin began his career with the Titans. The No. 8 pick in the 2016 draft, the former Michigan State Spartan was named a first-team All-Pro in his rookie season in Tennessee. ",Sports Illustrated,"Breaking, Nfl, Wire",Zach koons,"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 18:34:15 GMT",Cleveland will keep the two-time All-Pro in-house for at least the next few seasons.,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NjUxNTg0MTQ2MTg3NDI2/jack-conklin.jpg
https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/12/23/aaron-donald-injury-update-ankle-rest-of-season-sean-mcvay-los-angeles-rams,McVay: Aaron Donald Likely Done for Season With Ankle Injury,"The defensive tackle has missed the last few games with a high ankle sprain.
Rams head coach Sean McVay ruled Aaron Donald out for Sunday’s game vs. Denver, and that could be it for the defensive tackle this season. McVay added that Donald is “probably not” going to play again this year, according to Rams staff writer Stu Jackson.
Donald suffered a high ankle sprain in Los Angeles’s game vs. the Chiefs on November 28, and he hasn’t played in a game since. Sunday will be the fourth straight week where Donald is sidelined with the injury.
Prior to this season, Donald had been extremely durable, missing just two games in his first eight seasons in the NFL, both in 2017. If he does miss the rest of the year, he will play in a career-low 11 games this season and will miss triple the number of games that he had missed in his entire career to this point.
The Rams are firmly out of the playoff picture, and the team has no incentive to rush it’s stars back from injuries. Donald, wide receiver Cooper Kupp and quarterback Matthew Stafford will all likely remain on the sideline for the rest of the year as they recover from their various injuries.",Sports Illustrated,"Nfl, Wire, Breaking",Daniel chavkin,"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 18:29:43 GMT",The defensive tackle has missed the last few games with a high ankle sprain.,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NjUxOTIyNjQzMjk3ODE2/aaron-donald.jpg
