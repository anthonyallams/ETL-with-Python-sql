Literally minutes after getting bad news on one 5-star defensive tackle, Oklahoma fans got a little good news on another.
David Stone, one of the top-rated d-linemen in the country in the 2024 class, included OU in his top 10 schools on Friday.
Stone’s announcement — first reported on Twitter by On3 recruiting insider Hayes Fawcett — came just minutes after 2023 5-star d-tackle David Hicks announced on Twitter that he had signed with Texas A&M.
Stone included OU among Texas A&M, USC, Oregon, Alabama, Miami, Florida, LSU, Michigan State and Tennessee.
Stone has always been considered as a strong OU lean after growing up in Del City as a fan of the Sooners. 
“My dad used to make me watch the games growing up,” Stone told AllSooners recently. “At first I wasn’t really a fan of the sport but after I started to play little league myself, I understood a lot more of what was happening (and) they started to grow on me.”
Stone told AllSooners he appreciated the energy and culture at Oklahoma under Brent Venables and the new coaching staff.
“The energy and passion that they bring to the table, plus the understanding and knowledge of the game, mixed with their prior success at Clemson, seems second to none,” he said.
Stone said he’s spoken many times with current OU players about the coaching change from Lincoln Riley to Venables.
“They tell me stories about the old staff,” Stone said, “and they tell me what it’s like now, which is all good things. But I want to know how it really is at the schools I’m considering because I don’t want to get on campus and it be a complete shock to me of how things really (are) wherever I am.” 
He said at the time that OU and Michigan State were “battling it out for the top spot” but said there were also “a few schools right behind them” — and that included A&M.
Stone also acknowledged that Hicks’ commitment to A&M back in September caught him a little off guard. He said he wanted to try to play college football with Hicks, but didn’t know at the time where that would be.
“A&M’s always been high in my eyes before Hicks and before the NIL rule changes,” Stone said, “so regardless of what happens over there or the players coming or not, my relationship and trust I have in the staff alone is strong enough for me to decide to be an Aggie.”
The 6-foot-4, 270-pound Stone is the nation's No. 2 defensive tackle, according to 247 Sports, and ranks as the top player in Florida and the No. 4 overall player in the nation in the 2024 class. He grew up in Del City but just finished his junior season at IMG Academy in Bradenton, FL.

https://www.si.com/college/oklahoma/football/report-oklahoma-dl-target-david-hicks-signs-with-texas-a-m,Report: Oklahoma DL Target David Hicks Signs With Texas A&M,"The Sooners were hoping to flip the talented big man from Texas, but he stayed with his original commitment and signed with the Aggies on Friday.
Oklahoma’s hopes of landing the nation’s top defensive line recruit officially died on Friday. 
David “DJ” Hicks, a 5-star prospect and the top-rated interior d-lineman in the 2023 recruiting class, has been verbally committed to Texas A&M since September, and he followed through with that by signing with the Aggies. The news was first reported by On3 recruiting insider Hayes Fawcett.
Fawcett's Twitter post was quickly retweeted by Hicks.
It’s the second year in a row the Aggies have landed the best defensive lineman in the country. Last year A&M landed 5-star Walter Nolen of Powell, TN. 
The 6-foot-4, 295-pound Hicks played last year at Paetow High School in Katy, TX after playing his junior season at Allen, TX. He played his freshmen and sophomore seasons at Morton Ranch High School in Katy.
The Sooners could have used a boost on the defensive line, but still signed Ashton Sanders (6-1, 270), Derrick LeBlanc (6-5, 265) and Markus Strong (6-3, 265). OU’s class ranks No. 5 nationally in the 247 Sports team rankings and is No. 12, according to Sports Illustrated.

https://www.si.com/college/oklahoma/football/oklahomas-versatile-2023-linebacker-class-will-reinforce-the-core-of-brent-venables-defense,Oklahoma's Versatile 2023 Linebacker Class Will Reinforce the Core of Brent Venables' Defense,"Lewis Carter, Samuel Omosigho and Phil Picciotti all have varying skillsets that will help fill out the linebacker room as the trio develops at Oklahoma.
NORMAN — The future spine of Oklahoma’s defense is starting to take shape under Brent Venables.
In his first full recruiting cycle as the head coach for the Sooners, Venables landed a trio of linebackers that had him bristling with excitement in his Christmas-themed blazer during Wednesday’s National Signing Day press conference. 
Oklahoma signed Crandall, TX, product Samuel Omosigho, Lewis Carter out of Tampa Bay and Phil Picciotti from IMG Academy in Bradenton, FL, to round out the haul. 
All three displayed a violent streak on the high school football field, and Venables was especially excited about the versatility the trio will bring to the linebacker room in Norman.
Carter was a prospect who immediately jumped off the screen for Venables and the coaching staff when they started to dive into his film. 
He was rated the No. 12 overall linebacker by 247Sports’ Composite Rankings and the ninth-best player at his position by Rivals, but Venables saw Carter’s ceiling a bit higher. 
“In my opinion Lewis Carter was a top-five linebacker in the country with his speed and instincts, his agility,” Venables said. “He's every bit as good of a running back as he is a linebacker.”
His athleticism translated to plenty of production, as Carter racked up over 300 tackles, 10.5 sacks, four interceptions and four forced fumbles throughout his high school career. 
Omosigho is also someone who was right at home in the open field throughout his high school career. 
His speed allows him to bring great range to his position, something that will give him plenty of options as far as what role he will fill in the OU linebacker corps. 
“You start with his high school position. He plays wide out,” Oklahoma defensive coordinator and linebackers coach Ted Roof said. “They give him the ball some. He plays defensive end, he plays outside linebacker. He plays safety and plays on special teams. He never comes off the field. 
“… But to see where he fits in, obviously he's gonna be a linebacker. We're still evaluating things as far as the best spot for him. Some of that we won't know until he gets here.” 
As Omosigho develops, he may be able to take on more responsibility for the Sooners. But Roof said initially the plan will be to get him into space and let him begin to learn the playbook and start to experience the speed of college football. 
Picciotti, on the other hand, is likely to start out on the interior for Oklahoma.
A fundamentally sound player, it’s easy to envision Picciotti living at the heart of the defense based off what Venables loved about his high school film. 
“I felt like (Picciotti) was one of the most violent middle linebackers,” Venables said. “Just can't block this guy. Violent hands. Great instincts. 
“Really what you want to be strong on defense, just being strong up the middle.”
After starting his career in Perkasie, PA, Picciotti decided to test himself amongst some of the best athletes in the country at IMG Academy in 2022. 
The offseason addition of Dasan McCullough from Indiana as well as the return of Danny Stutsman and potentially David Ugwoegbu could mean OU’s 2023 linebacker class is a slow burn. 
This year, true freshman Jaren Kanak was used sparingly while fellow newcomers Kobie McKinzie and Kip Lewis redshirted. 
But whenever Carter, Omosigho and Picciotti are ready to contribute, Roof believes the Sooners signed a trio of instinctual players with a good grasp of the game, as evidenced by all three players’ use on both sides of the ball in high school. 
“The high school coaches are all good coaches and they want to get their best players the ball,” Roof said. “They found different ways to get them the ball. They are were very productive, Sammy at wide receiver, Phil was a fullback and some tailback. Lewis was a Wildcat quarterback and tailback and all over the place.
“… I love that. I think that helps instincts when you know the other side of the ball – the opposite side that you are playing on – there’s a lot of value in that. Then you have a better understanding of the other side of the ball, which makes you a better player on the defensive side of the ball.”

https://www.si.com/college/oklahoma/football/why-oklahomas-gracen-halton-says-because-of-todd-bates-youll-see-me-in-the-nfl,"Why Oklahoma's Gracen Halton Says Because of Todd Bates, 'You'll See Me in the NFL'","There's a reason why Oklahoma's defensive linemen have serious confidence in highly regarded coach assistant Todd Bates.
Despite an inconsistent season on the field, falling way short of the team’s preseason goals, Oklahoma’s young pieces remain locked in for the long haul.
It wasn’t the defensive resurgence expected by many in Brent Venables’ first season in Norman. Oklahoma won just six games, and the defensive problems of past Sooner teams seemed to show up all season long.
After losing a large amount of defensive talent to the NFL last offseason, a steeper dropoff likely should’ve been expected in hindsight. With so many departures, though, some of the talented youngsters found ways to have an impact on the field. 
Despite the rough patches throughout the season, the future still looks promising, especially on the defensive side of the ball. Struggles on the field opened the door for early playing time. Players like freshman defensive lineman Gracen Halton, who found playing time at multiple positions and reaffirmed his trust in d-line coach Todd Bates and the rest of the coaching staff, are a big reason way.
“I'll say the one word is trust,” Halton said. “You know, all those guys that came before me (at Clemson) trusted him. And he put them in the league. So I'm just trusting him. Coach Bates, two or three years, four years, you’ll see me in the NFL.” 
After spending the past few seasons with the Tigers, Bates developed quite the reputation for developing defensive linemen and helping his guys reach the next level. The addition of Bates was an important hire for Oklahoma’s future plans to move to the SEC.
Even though Oklahoma didn’t experience the expected on-field defensive success this season, Bates’ track record is still strong and the highly touted recruits from a season ago have reason to believe. Both Halton and fellow freshman R Mason Thomas progressed throughout the season and earned more snaps towards the end of the year. Halton finished the season logging 73 snaps, while Thomas led all defensive freshmen with 212 snaps. Their improvement throughout this fall adds another reason to trust Bates.
“He knows about ball,” Halton said. “He knows about the game, just like, technique and everything else. So you know, everything that we run, you know, it makes sense. It's not like I'm watching film and it’s like, ‘Oh, I don't understand this, coach, I don’t understand this.’ Because I'm looking at it like, ‘OK coach, I get what you're saying.’ So I know already, from the knowledge that he has, he's gonna get me ready to go.”
For Halton and the rest of the defensive line, having a coach as knowledgeable as Bates is a great resource. He knows how Oklahoma’s defense operates, and how to best help his players get to the next level.
“Oh, every day,” Halton said. “He's gonna tell me what to avoid and what to do right. You know, everything is 'Do everything right,' you know, try to do everything right. If I don't do it right, then he's on me. So that's what it is. That's true love right there.”

https://www.si.com/college/oklahoma/football/why-ratings-stars-and-other-metrics-show-2023-is-oklahomas-best-defensive-class-in-years,"Why Ratings, Stars and Other Metrics Show 2023 is Oklahoma's Best Defensive Class in Years","It's the first time the Sooners have signed more than one 5-star, and the numbers show Brent Venables and his staff are serious about recruiting defense.
It took a while, but Oklahoma finally reeling in Peyton Bowen has elevated the Sooners’ 2023 class to new heights.
The narrative going into National Signing Day — his first full recruiting cycle as head coach — Brent Venables signed OU’s best defensive class in at least the last 10 years. 
Now, with Bowen’s signature coming in on Thursday, the data supports that narrative.
Venables’ class of 25 total players includes 15 defenders. That’s the most since the 2018 class included 15, and is just off the 2015 class’ number of 16. 
Using the 247 Sports rankings, the Sooners’ average player ranking in this year’s class — defense only — is .9185 (a perfect score is 1.000). That’s actually a notch below the 2021 class’s per-player average of .9210. 
But that year, Lincoln Riley only signed 10 defensive players. 
Included in that 2021 class were eight 4-stars and zero 5-stars. This year’s class includes eight 4-stars, but also features two 5-stars in Bowen and edge rusher P.J. Adeboware. 
Ronald W. Erdrich/Reporter-News-Imagn Content Services, LLC
Defensive backs Makari Vickers, Jacobe Johnson and Jasiah Wagner, defensive lineman Derrick LeBlanc and linebackers Sammy Omosigho and Lewis Carter came in as highly rated recruits. DBs Daeh McCullough, Kendel Dolby and Erik McCarty, linebacker Phil Picciotti and defensive linemen Ashton Sanders, Taylor Wein and Markus Strong fill out a well-rounded class of versatile athletes who, Venables said, play with ""violence"" in their game.
""We’re looking for runners,"" Venables said. ""We’re looking for guys that like contact. You can’t ever go wrong when you’re talking about defensive players, guys that can run and hit.""
This year also represents the first time in the modern era of online recruiting rankings that the Sooners have landed two 5-stars on defense in the same year.
Oklahoma’s defensive 5-stars in the last 25 years, according to 247 Sports, are Tommie Harris (2001), DeMarcus Granger (2005), R.J. Washington (2008), Gerald McCoy (2006), Moe Dampeer (2003), Chris Patterson (2004), Jamarkus McFarland (2009), Tony Cade (2003), Caleb Kelly (2016), Zach Latimer (2002) and Marcus Walker (2004). 
The Sooners’ average per-player ranking for defenders in the 2018 class was high, too — .9128.
But OU signed seven defenders in this year’s class with a 247 Sports ranking of .9300 or higher. That’s way more than the three OU signed in 2021 and the four the Sooners landed in 2018. 
Venables’ defensive chops — and his staff of dynamic recruiters — are paying dividends. One full recruiting class shows that Venables is already making headway as the Sooners begin the transition to the Southeastern Conference.
""I'm really proud of our staff and all the people internally,"" Venables said. ""J.R. Sandlin and Lee Davis, amongst others, Drew Hill and J.P. (Losman). They just did an outstanding job. They were relentless in their work to finding the right guys that are going to fit the profile that we're looking for here at Oklahoma."" 
Combining numerous metrics, including sheer quantity and varying degrees of quality, the 2023 class stands as Oklahoma’s best in at least a decade.

https://www.si.com/college/oklahoma/football/eight-former-oklahoma-players-selected-to-pro-bowl-rosters,Eight Former Oklahoma Players Selected to Pro Bowl Rosters,"The eight former Sooners will participate in the week-long all-star event in Las Vegas after the season.
A collection of former Oklahoma stars get rewarded for their efforts in the professional ranks.
With the NFL season winding down with only three weeks remaining, the league released their official Pro Bowl rosters this week - with eight former Sooners earning selections. 
Quarterback Jalen Hurts, wide receiver CeeDee Lamb, offensive linemen Trent Williams, Lane Johnson, Orlando Brown and Creed Humphrey, tight end Mark Andrews and punter Tress Way will all be representing their respective franchises and conferences at the all-star showcase in early February. 
Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports
Hurts is in the midst of a potentially MVP-caliber season as he has led the Philadelphia Eagles to a 13-1 mark on the year behind 3,472 yards passing and 22 touchdowns with another 747 yards and an additional 13 scores on the ground. 
Lamb and Andrews have both been their productive selves as well on a couple of playoff hopefuls, with Lamb catching 81 passes for 1,087 yards and six touchdowns and Andrews hauling in 61 receptions for 702 yards and five scores. 
Williams, Johnson, Brown and Humphrey, meanwhile, have all served as among the four very best offensive linemen in the sport and are all featured on legitimate Super Bowl contenders in the San Francisco 49ers, Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs, respectively.
Way rounds out the group with another big season as quite arguably the best punter in football, getting selected to the Pro Bowl for the second time in his career. 
The Pro Bowl, which has gotten a makeover as the “Pro Bowl Games” this year, is set for Sunday, Feb. 5 in Las Vegas and will feature flag football game preceded by a week-long series of events leading up to the weekend. ","Sports Illustrated Oklahoma Sooners News, Analysis and More","Oklahoma sooners football, Lane johnson, Oklahoma, Ou sooners football, Oklahoma football, Ou football, Ou, Jalen hurts, Oklahoma athletics, Ou sooners, Mark andrews, Sooners in the nfl, Trent williams, Football, Creed humphrey, Oklahoma sooners, Sooners athletics, Ou athletics, Sooner football, Tress way, Sooners football, Ceedee lamb, Orlando brown",Josh callaway,"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 22:55:59 GMT",The eight former Sooners will participate in the week-long all-star event in Las Vegas after the season.,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NjMzMDYyMDk5NzIzNDI2/usatsi_19647164.jpg

https://www.si.com/college/oklahoma/football/signing-day-shocker-s-peyton-bowen-signs-with-oklahoma-after-flipping-from-oregon,Signing Day Shocker: S Peyton Bowen Signs With Oklahoma After Flipping from Oregon,"The longtime Notre Dame commit flipped to Oregon on Wednesday, but joined Oklahoma's 2023 signing class on Thursday.
Oklahoma’s coaching staff never gave up, and as a result pulled off an unlikely recruiting victory — and a big one.
Peyton Bowen, the nation’s No. 2-ranked safety by 247Sports’ Composite Rankings and high school teammate of OU quarterback signee Jackson Arnold, improbably signed his National Letter of Intent with Oklahoma on Thursday. 
""As I reflect on yesterday's whirlwind,"" Bowen wrote, ""I recognize that I made some mistakes that I regret and will learn from. Navigating this process has been a rollercoaster.""
Though the Sooners have long been involved in Bowen’s recruitment, OU’s hopes appeared dead on Wednesday. 
It was Oregon coach Dan Lanning who seemed to have the last laugh on National Signing Day as the longtime Notre Dame commit publicly announced he would flip his commitment to the Ducks, airing his announcement on Instagram Live. 
Surrounded by family, Bowen only had a Notre Dame hat and an Oregon hat handy for his announcement yesterday. 
In the moment, the announcement didn’t come as a surprise to Oklahoma, as a source told to AllSooners.com that contact between Bowen and the OU coaching staff waned in the moments before his streamed his announcement. 
Peyton Bowen via social media
But as Bowen apparently delayed sending in his signed NLI, Oklahoma’s coaching staff continued to recruit Bowen Wednesday evening and into Thursday. Venables noted in his National Signing Day press conference there would be ""more to come.""
AllSooners asked Venables Wednesday if, in the era of the transfer portal, he had to maintain strong relationships with prospects that sign elsewhere or if, after spending so much time and resources on a single prospect, some bridges are just burned.
""I wouldn't say it's burned,"" Venables said. ""I wouldn't say — I really don't know. I think you would evaluate each situation and how the recruiting went. Haven't really — I mean, in a day in the life of a recruiter, you have to already anticipate what's next. OK, you have this amazing product, this amazing opportunity. But a lot of people have the same things to offer whether we like to see that or not. That's how I've always looked at it. 
""So what are you gonna do if that doesn't work? What's the next best plan, or option? What are we going to do? We like to be very individualized and instead of going after three of them for one (scholarship), in a situation like that, let's go all in and, if we come up short, we know what we're going to do next. But you try to be genuine and sincere with the one that we want. You know, one at a time."" 
OU’s perseverance was rewarded, as the Sooners have finally added the consensus 5-star prospect. Bowen's addition jumps OU from No. 7 in the 247 Sports team rankings to No,. 5.
Bowen marks Oklahoma’s seventh defensive back signee in the 2023 class, as Jay Valai and Brandon Hall worked overtime to restock OU’s secondary with talent. 
Defensive backs C.J. Coldon, Trey Morrison and Justin Broiles will all play their final game as a Sooner in the Cheez-It Bowl as their eligibility expires. 
The attrition on the back end of the defense continued when Jordan Mukes, Joshua Eaton, Kendall Dennis and Bryson Washington all decided to enter the transfer portal after not breaking through in 2022 under the new defensive staff. 
Bowen projects to be more than just a number for Hall, however. 
The 6-foot, 185-pounder from Denton, TX, was one of the premier playmakers in the nation this past season at Guyer High School. 
A fluid athlete, Bowen was a menace patrolling the back end of the defense. He has the athletic ability to close ground quickly, and the ball skills to step in and pick off opposing quarterbacks. 
His production as a kick returner also flashes his ability to make plays with the football in his hands, as Bowen is a legitimate game-breaker. 
With the addition of Bowen, Oklahoma has officially signed 25 players in the Early Signing Period, including 15 defensive signees.

NORMAN — Brent Venables received word midway through his National Signing Day press conference on Wednesday that he could officially talk about Notre Dame transfer Jacob Lacey. 
And wow, did Venables talk.
“Jacob’s a guy that we had a relationship with while we were at Clemson,” Venables said of the Sooners’ new graduate defensive tackle. “Again, he's been a leader. Incredibly tough and versatile.”
Lacey entered the transfer portal on Oct. 6, leaving the Fighting Irish just four games into his senior year. That decision probably wasn’t easy, but it allowed him to take a redshirt in 2022, which gives him two years of eligibility in Norman. 
“A young man that we really felt like would be able to mentor some of the younger players,” Venables said. “He's got great maturity, but natural leadership skills and would bring great value to our locker room, having played at Notre Dame and having college experience.” 
His arrival for 2023 is ideal for an Oklahoma defense that loses Jalen Redmond to the NFL Draft, plus seniors Jeffery Johnson and Jordan Kelley to graduation, and senior Josh Ellison and freshmen Alton Tarber and Cedric Roberts to the transfer portal.
“That’s a bunch of guys all at once on your defensive line,” Venables said. “So, Jacob’s a guy that we really are excited about being here at mid-year.”
According to 247 Sports, Lacey was the No. 10 defensive tackle in the nation in the class of 2019, No. 157 overall. ESPN ranked him No. 114 nationally coming out of South Warren High School in Bowling Green, KY. He was the 2018 Kentucky 5A Player of the Year. He picked Notre Dame over Clemson, Kentucky, Cincinnati, Louisville, Michigan, Michigan State, Penn State, Tennessee and others.
Lacey played in 12 games at Notre Dame as a true freshman (career-high 247 snaps), recording a career-best 76.2 grade against Navy, according to Pro Football Focus. He played in 11 games (164 snaps)
in 2020 and 11 games in 2021 (149 snaps), but only played the first four games of 2022 (73 snaps) before deciding to redshirt and enter the transfer portal. 
Lacey’s PFF grade as a freshman was 62.8. That dipped to 61.9 his sophomore year, but soared to 70.0 as a junior. 
Last year’s grade — limited action in just four games — was 68.7. His playing time dwindled from 29 snaps against Ohio State to 24 against Cal to to 11 in the loss to Marshall, to nine against North Carolina.
“Lacey was a great player,” first-year coach Marcus Freeman said in October. “Lacey did a lot of great things for us, but it’s a deep position and he made a decision that ultimately he felt was best for him and we respect that. We love Jacob and the best thing about it is he leaves here with a degree in his hand.”
Regardless of how his playing days ended in South Bend, Venables is glad to rekindle his relationship with Lacey. He comes to Oklahoma with 633 career snaps, according to PFF.
“Probably going to be just an inside guy,” Venables said. “But a guy that understands leverage and how to play the game. He's got a good foundation of fundamentals and moves well.”","Sports Illustrated Oklahoma Sooners News, Analysis and More","National signing day, Cedric roberts, Boomer, Ou, Marcus freeman, Sooner football, Boomer sooner, Notre dame fighting irish, Sooners, Oklahoma, Football, Jordan kelley, Sooner nation, Alton tarber, Brent venables, Sooner recruiting, Ou football, Jacob lacey, Ou recruiting, Oklahoma football, Oklahoma sooners, Pro football focus, Pff, Oklahoma recruiting, Josh ellison, Jeffery johnson, Ou sooners, Jalen redmond",John e. hoover,"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 19:50:41 GMT","Lacey's playing time dwindled in four seasons at Notre Dame, but he logged more than 600 snaps and represents a real need for a Sooner d-line gutted by attrition.",https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NjMwMTM4MDMyMzAxMjE4/jacob-lacey-nd.jpg
