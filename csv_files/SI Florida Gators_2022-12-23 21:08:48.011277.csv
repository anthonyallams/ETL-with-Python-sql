Florida redshirt freshman cornerback Jordan Young announced his plans to enter the transfer portal on Friday.
""Ever since I was a young child, it has been my absolute desire and dream to attend the University of Florida and wear the respected colors of orange and blue. As a proud Floridian and competitive athlete, it has been no greater honor,"" Young wrote on Twitter.
""I am forever thankful to my family, friends, and support system who have encouraged and aided me along my journey as a Florida Gator. In addition, I would also like to extend a special thank you to the entire Gator nation, my teammates with whom I had the pleasure of competing alongside, and the University of Florida academic and athletic training department and staff.
""Although it wasn't in my heart's desire, after careful deliberation amongst my family, I've concluded it is within my best interest to enter the transfer portal, so that I may have the opportunity to showcase my God given talents, and abilities as an athlete and Scholar.""
Young, a product of Tampa (Fla.) Gaither and member of the 2021 signing class, appeared in 13 games during his UF career as a boundary and slot corner, in addition to a significant special teams role.
He compiled 11 total tackles, a pass breakup and a blocked field goal over two seasons, posting his special teams highlight in his final game as a Gator against Oregon State in the Las Vegas Bowl. 
Young is the 20th scholarship Florida player to announce plans to transfer this offseason and the second to do so since the bowl game on Dec. 17, following starting right tackle Michael Tarquin's departure on Thursday. He's also the fifth Gators defensive back to leave the program this postseason. 
12 scholarship UF players have found new homes so far: Running back Lorenzo Lingard (Akron), tight ends Nick Elksnis (South Carolina) and Griffin McDowell (UT-Chattanooga), offensive lineman Joshua Braun (Arkansas), defensive lineman Jalen Lee (LSU), outside linebackers Lloyd Summerall III (USF) and Chief Borders (Nebraska), defensive backs Corey Collier Jr. (Nebraska), Avery Helm (TCU), Donovan McMillon (Pittsburgh) and Kamar Wilcoxson (Temple) and long snapper Marco Ortiz (Nebraska).
  Florida signed cornerbacks Dijon Johnson, Ja'Keem Jackson and Aaron Gates, safeties Jordan Castell and Bryce Thornton and nickel corner Sharif Denson as defensive back members of its 2023 recruiting class during the early signing period.

Florida offensive tackle Michael Tarquin plans to enter the transfer portal, he announced on Thursday.
""I am very thankful to have had the opportunity to play football and get my degree at the University of Florida,"" Tarquin wrote on Twitter. ""I appreciate everyone who has helped me in this process thus far, and I cherish every relationship I have built at UF. That being said I am putting my name in the NCAA transfer portal.""
Tarquin, listed as a fourth-year redshirt sophomore on Florida's roster and a product of Ocala (Fla.) North Marion, inherited the role of starting right tackle in 2022 following Jean Delance's departure to the NFL and head coach Billy Napier's arrival in Gainesville. 
However, a lower-body injury suffered in Week 2 limited Tarquin to nine games throughout the year and allowed redshirt freshman Austin Barber to emerge in the lineup. By season's end, Barber regularly rotated with Tarquin, and starting left tackle Richard Gouraige, on both ends of the offensive line. 
Barber was awarded First-Team Freshman All-American recognition by College Football News in December as a result of his breakthrough.
  With Tarquin looking elsewhere and Gouraige off to the NFL, Barber will be expected to start at tackle for Florida in 2023. Who will start at the Gators' opposite tackle spot, however, remains in question.
UF listed Barber as its only backup at tackle, both left and right, on its depleted depth chart ahead of the Las Vegas Bowl earlier in December. 
Redshirt freshman Kamryn Waites is the only other Florida player to have appeared in a game at offensive tackle in 2022, earning 31 snaps at the position. He moved to right guard for his next two appearances, against South Carolina and Oregon State, starting in the latter matchup. 
Florida signed one offensive tackle during the 2023 early signing period on Wednesday, Rockledge (Fla.) High's Bryce Lovett.

https://www.si.com/college/florida/recruiting/florida-gators-recruiting-desmond-ricks-commits-alabama,Florida CB Target Desmond Ricks Commits to Alabama,"Florida's top remaining defensive back target will play for SEC rival Alabama at the next level.
Bradenton (Fla.) IMG Academy cornerback Desmond Ricks announced his commitment to Alabama over Florida and LSU in a signing day ceremony on Thursday.
Ricks quickly emerged as Florida's No. 1 target remaining at cornerback as the 2023 recruiting cycle neared its close, after Lakeland (Fla.) High's Cormani McClain surprisingly committed to the Miami Hurricanes on Oct. 27. 
Ricks, a Chesapeake, Va., native, reclassified to the 2023 class from 2024 on Oct. 22. He made a short turnaround by trimming his list of desired schools down to three on Nov. 3, including the Gators, thanks primarily to cornerbacks coach Corey Raymond's recruiting efforts.
  ""Coach Raymond is the reason I'm here,"" Ricks told All Gators following his visit to campus in July for UF's Grill in the Ville recruiting event. ""Everybody else is having their cookout today, but I decided to come here to see coach Raymond because he's the best doing it ... with him being known for developing players.""
Ricks would go on to officially visit Florida between Dec. 2-4, a week following an official trip to Alabama and a week before an official trip to LSU. In the end, his trek to Tuscaloosa made the best impression.
Florida signed cornerbacks Dijon Johnson, Ja'Keem Jackson and Aaron Gates, safeties Jordan Castell and Bryce Thornton and nickel corner Sharif Denson as defensive back members of its 2023 recruiting class on Wednesday.

https://www.si.com/college/florida/recruiting/florida-gators-recruiting-billy-napier-reflects-dynamic-receiver-class-2023,Billy Napier Reflects on Gators' Dynamic 2023 Wide Receiver Class,"The Gators pulled in ""three of the best receivers in the entire country"" to bolster a thin pass catcher room in the 2023 cycle, according to Billy Napier.
Just three years removed from a roster with six NFL-caliber wide receivers and an All-American tight end, Florida's WR room has quickly deteriorated to a top-heavy unit with a lack of dynamic playmaking ability among its ranks.
As a result, when Billy Napier, Keary Colbert and Co. embarked on the first full recruiting class of their tenure in Gainesville, one of the largest areas of emphasis was to re-equip the position with the talent it once had. 
The tangibles they looked for specifically were speed, explosiveness and outright playmaking ability to pair with the skillsets of rising seniors Xzavier Henderson and Ricky Pearsall, rising sophomore Caleb Douglas and a few others as possession receiver threats next season.
While they didn't bring in the quantity initially expected to bolster the depth, Florida still made strides to rejuvenate the room with pieces on the outside and in the slot in 2023, earning the signatures of in-state pass catchers Eugene ""Tre"" Wilson III, Aidan Mizell and Andy Jean.
Napier spoke highly of their accomplishments at the position on the trail this class during his 2022 Early National Signing Day press conference on Wednesday.
""These are really good people and fantastic football players,"" he said. ""I think, three of the best receivers in the entire country.""
The high praise from the Gators' head coach comes for a good reason, as each produced at a level at the prep level to suggest their impact at the next level will be immense.
The variety in each of their games is an essential aspect of their transition to the next level, as each possesses a skill set that will make them unique to the offense when their number is called.
Wilson, a speedy and elusive wideout in the slot, has the potential to be the guy the Gators get involved in the flats and allow him to do the rest after the catch. The wiggle he holds as a ball carrier is a product of Florida's well-known desire to acquire speed in space this cycle.
Wilson will be the one who accomplishes that goal at a premium rate.
""Tre Wilson is one of the more dynamic slot, run-after-catch returners,"" Napier said. ""Just a very explosive, instinctive player. He does some really unique things on tape, relative to adjusting to the ball, run after catch. He's dynamic. You can throw an intermediate, short pass to this guy, and he's a one touchdown player.
""I think he's one of these players [who is] very polished.""
As the son of former NFL cornerback and Super Bowl winner Eugene Wilson II, the Gaither athlete's polish is a direct reflection of his knowledge and access to the game's intricacies, usually learned via trial and error. However, having his process expedited with the luxury of a close example of what it takes to play at a high level, Wilson is a mature player for his age.
That will result in his near-immediate usage in the UF air attack next season, even though he will not arrive on campus until the summer.
""He'll bring a lot to our team right away,"" Napier said.
The next player on Florida's signee board brings the deep threat ability that the Gators sorely missed in 2022. Despite the connection between Anthony Richardson and Justin Shorter — a big-bodied possession receiver plugged into the deep route role out of need — on occasion at the deep level of the field, the presence of a player with the straight-line speed to take the top off of defenses lacked.
Mizell is precisely that, with the verified track speed to be a dynamic entity out wide.
""We're talking about elite speed,"" Napier said on Wednesday. ""He was injured this year, obviously missed the majority of the year, but he's a tough guy, plays the game that way. Very explosive player in the vertical throw game and run after catch. But this is a very unique athlete. 
""He's going to run track here as well. He's one of the best 400-meter guys in the entire country, and certainly, ran 10.6 100 meters this past spring as a junior. So we're talking about elite speed. Got character. Very bright.
""It means something to him to be at the University of Florida, and you certainly can appreciate that. So he's going to bring a lot to the table.""
However, Mizell is the most prominent project piece of the three. Before he can see the field in a high volume capacity, Mark Hocke and the strength and condition staff will need to add weight to his 162-pound frame while maintaining his highlight reel speed. 
Even then, there isn't much work to be done until he's ready, needing just 10-to-15 pounds of muscle before he can be a serviceable option.
He will have the spring and summer to get to that point as an early enrollee, boding well for his potential emergence on the field for meaningful snaps as a true freshman.
Finally, despite aligning as the lowest-ranked player in the trio, according to the On3 Consensus rankings (54th ranked wideout and 367th ranked player nationally), Jean presents arguably the most upside of the three prospects at the next level.
He stands out as a prototypical boundary wideout at 6-foot-1, 182 pounds, with the length to present a threat to make routine and contested catches with ease.
Zach Goodall
Showcasing his prowess as an elite route runner with a propensity to create space with swift movement in and out of his breaks, the Northwestern (Miami, Fla.) product brings the ability to work the route tree in its entirety. That's a luxury the Gators didn't have in 2022
""This guy can run the route tree,"" Napier exclaimed when asked to expound on Jean's skill set. ""This guy has a unique acceleration. He can really eat up the coverage. He can get behind you. 
""I respect Andy, just his attitude and approach to life. He's a blue-collar guy. He's a worker. Really a lot of respect for his family. They work extremely hard.""
That work ethic could pay dividends for him as he begins his Gators career in the spring.
Overall, the class, albeit a small one, is a success from the standpoint of Florida pulling in ready-now pieces with the dynamic skill set to contribute and excel at the beginning of the season.
Each piece fills a noticeable hole on the exterior of the Gators' offense. However, with adequate time learning from Colbert in the spring and summer, each guy should be able to fulfill at least a minimal role in the lineup starting in September when Florida hits the road to Salt Lake City, Utah.

https://www.si.com/college/florida/recruiting/florida-gators-recruiting-jordan-hall-commits-georgia-2023,Florida DL Target Jordan Hall Commits to Georgia,"Florida misses out on one of its top defensive line recruits, Jordan Hall, following his commitment to Georgia.
One of the Gators' top class of 2023 recruiting targets, regardless of position, Jacksonville (Fla.) Westside defensive lineman Jordan Hall committed to Georgia over Florida, Alabama and LSU on Thursday. 

View the original article to see embedded media.

Florida signed Gardendale (Ala.) High's Kelby Collins, Orlando (Fla.) Olympia's Kamran James, Thomaston (Ga.), Camden (N.J.) Eastside's Will Norman, Gainesville (Fla.) Buchholz's Gavin Hill and Lousiville transfer Caleb Banks as defensive line members of its 2023 recruiting class on Wednesday. Thomaston (Ga.) Upson-Lee's TJ Searcy also joined the class officially as an edge rusher.
Still, Hall's loss to the rival Bulldogs certainly stings as Florida aimed to put a bow on top of a deep class of defensive line signees. 
He immediately emerged as one of Florida's class of 2023 priorities upon the arrival of head coach Billy Napier. Hall made the short trip from the 904 to the 352 for eight visits this year, most recently on an official basis from Dec. 2-4.
However, an official trip to Athens, Ga. the week after while Florida prepared for its Las Vegas Bowl appearance ultimately sealed the deal in the Dawgs' favor.
Hall is considered the No. 10 defensive lineman and No. 102 prospect nationwide in the class of 2023, per the On3 Sports consensus rankings. He compiled 202 tackles, 19 sacks, 60 tackles for loss, three forced fumbles and six batted passes in his four-year varsity career at Westside.

While his recruitment may not have gone exactly to Florida's plan, the nation's No. 3 quarterback in the class of 2023 ended up a Gator when it came time to put pen to paper.
Jaden Rashada, also the nation's No. 7 overall prospect according to the SI99, signed his National Letter of Intent on Wednesday to make his commitment to the University of Florida official.
His signature capped off Florida's class of 2023 high school signings for the early signing period, much to the pleasure of head coach Billy Napier. 
Scheduled to address the media at 4 p.m. on Wednesday evening, UF postponed Napier's signing day conference by just over an hour while awaiting Rashada's paperwork. Once it arrived, Napier immediately spoke to the significance of Rashada's pledge.
""Can't compliment Jaden enough relative to who he is as a person, as a leader, his character,"" Napier praised upon his arrival on the podium. ""Jaden is a guy who came here and fell in love with the University of Florida and really connected with a lot of people here. It was sincere.""
While Rashada may have fallen in love with the University of Florida, it appeared to take him some time to realize it.
Rashada emerged as Florida's No. 1 quarterback target over the summer and reciprocated the Gators' interest. He visited UF twice, first in late May and then again on an official basis from June 7-9 before his originally scheduled commitment date of June 18.
However, much as they have since Mario Cristobal's introduction as head coach, the Miami Hurricanes came calling at the 11th hour, convinced Rashada to push his commitment back a week and secured his final official visit from June 21-23.
Come June 26, Rashada had committed to the Canes. It wasn't until Nov. 11 — when Florida sat at 5-4 and was freshly removed from a 41-24 road victory over Texas A&M, while Miami was 4-5 and had just been slaughtered by Florida State, 45-3 — that Rashada flipped his pledge to the Gators.
Napier and his coaching staff never waned while pressing for Rashada to flip his commitment, thanks to the relationship they had built over time with the prospect.
""I think we felt like the connection is real, and we felt like there was something there,"" Napier explained. ""We felt we were really close.
""Obviously a lot goes into these decisions, but certainly as time went on, we were consistent there ... there was common ground, and I think the connection was real. Just think there's a high level of trust on both ends there. I'm really excited about what he's going to bring to our team.""
So, too, is anyone looking toward the future of Florida football.
Rashada is viewed not only as the leader of UF's 2023 recruiting class but also as the centerpiece of Florida's offenses to come over the next few seasons. While he may not start as a true freshman, the Gators' have created a path for the gunslinger to inherit the QB1 role sooner rather than later with the incoming addition of Wisconsin signal-caller Graham Mertz.
Mertz, with three years of starting experience, is considered a bridge quarterback for Florida while Rashada develops physically and mentally behind the scenes. Mertz is expected to compete with Jack Miller III for UF's starting quarterback job entering 2023, but neither is regarded as a long-term solution behind center. 
Miller, who started at quarterback in the Las Vegas Bowl for Florida, underperformed as the offense scored its mere three points at the end of the fourth quarter. Mertz, meanwhile, possesses just two seasons of eligibility and didn't meet expectations at Wisconsin as a former borderline four/five-star prospect out of high school. 
Once Rashada adds a little weight to his 6-foot-3, 185-pound frame, Florida could reasonably pivot from the veterans to the freshman at any time thanks to his skill set and potential.
Napier propped Rashada up for his California Division 1-A playoff run with Pittsburg High this season, in which he tossed for 3,005 yards, 32 touchdowns and 13 interceptions with a career-high 62.4 completion percentage. He also added 419 yards and seven scores on the ground.
The Pirates made it to the state championship game on Dec. 10 but lost to Bakersfield (Calif.) Liberty, 48-20.
""One of the more highly regarded quarterbacks in the country,"" Napier noted about Rashada. ""I think the ball really jumps out of his hand. He's a junkie. He loves the game. He's all about the work. I think he's got a good sturdy frame that we can add weight to. Just been very impressed with his approach.""
Rashada will enroll at Florida in January, following his performance in the upcoming Under Armour All-American Bowl on Jan. 3 in Orlando, Fla.

https://www.si.com/college/florida/football/florida-gators-football-running-back-lorenzo-lingard-transfers-akron,Former Gators RB Lorenzo Lingard Transfers to Akron,"Former Gators running back Lorenzo Lingard shared that he is transferring to the Akron Zips on Wednesday.

Former Florida Gators running back Lorenzo Lingard announced the Akron Zips as his transfer destination on Wednesday.
He enters the fold as a sixth-year transfer for Joe Moorehead’s squad after enduring a rough stretch throughout the longevity of his career.
When Lingard initially committed to Florida after spending his first two collegiate seasons at Miami, which were derailed by a significant knee injury, the former five-star prospect patched a considerable hole of depth in a running backs room that failed to land a ball carrier from the high school ranks for two consecutive cycles. 
His emergence added depth to the unit behind the likes of Dameon Pierce and Malik Davis heading into the 2020 season. He was slated to assume a role in the offense when those in front of him moved on.
However, instead of rising up the ranks, Lingard consistently sat as a bottom feeder in the room. He was skipped over by younger talent, like Trevor Etienne and Montrell Johnson, despite his best efforts to break through the apparent glass ceiling.
He saw minimal time in each season with Florida, resulting in his decision to transfer after the year.
His most meaningful workload came against LSU in 2022, where he totaled 16 yards on three carries and seven yards in one catch. Whereas, his most productive game was against FCS Eastern Washington in the same season, where Lingard posted 45 yards on five attempts.
Lingard compiled 150 yards and one touchdown on 26 carries with the Gators over three seasons.
He will now suit up for the Zips in his final year of eligibility looking to resurrect his career in a hurry. 
12 of the 18 scholarship Florida players who entered the portal this offseason have identified their transfer destinations thus far: Lingard, tight ends Nick Elksnis (South Carolina) and Griffin McDowell (UT-Chattanooga), offensive lineman Joshua Braun (Arkansas), defensive lineman Jalen Lee (LSU), outside linebackers Lloyd Summerall III (USF) and Chief Borders (Nebraska), defensive backs Corey Collier Jr. (Nebraska), Avery Helm (TCU), Donovan McMillon (Pittsburgh) and Kamar Wilcoxson (Temple) and long snapper Marco Ortiz (Nebraska).

https://www.si.com/college/florida/football/florida-gators-recruiting-caleb-banks-signs-louisville-transfer,DL Transfer Caleb Banks Signs With Gators,"Florida signed five defensive linemen to kick off the 2023 early signing period, the final one being Louisville transfer Caleb Banks.
Defensive lineman Caleb Banks' transfer from Louisville to Florida was made official on Wednesday as he was named among the Gators' 22 early signing period additions to UF's 2023 roster.
A rising redshirt sophomore, Banks maintains three seasons of college eligibility to utilize at Florida. 
Banks, a native of Southfield, Mich., was considered a consensus three-star prospect in the class of 2021. At the time, he opted to sign with Louisville over offers from Arizona State — where he was at one point committed — Tennessee, Michigan State, Michigan and Pittsburgh, among others.
He entered the portal officially on Dec. 5 and earned at least 12 scholarship offers from various programs within 72 hours, quickly emerging as one of the top transfers available in the nation.
  Banks is listed at 6-foot-7, 300 pounds on Florida's signing day release. The towering trench monster appeared in six games for Louisville during the 2022 season, recording just two total tackles — one of those being for loss — a sack, a forced fumble and three quarterback pressures (per Pro Football Focus) across all of 38 defensive snaps.
He is expected to take on a meaningful role in Florida's defense rather immediately considering the team's lack of depth on the defensive line entering 2023.
Additionally, Florida signed defensive linemen Kelby Collins, Gavin Hill, Kamran James and Will Norman from the high school ranks on Wednesday.

https://www.si.com/college/florida/football/florida-gators-football-quarterback-graham-mertz-transfer,QB Graham Mertz Announces Transfer to Florida Gators,"Wisconsin Badgers quarterback transfer Graham Mertz officially announces his commitment to the Florida Gators.
The Gators have their bridge piece at quarterback, it seems, as Wisconsin transfer Graham Mertz officially announced Florida as his new home on Wednesday evening.
The development confirms reports of his intention to transfer to Florida from late Tuesday evening.
He comes to UF with two seasons is eligibility remaining.
Following the departure of quarterback Anthony Richardson to the 2023 NFL Draft, and the dismissal of backup Jalen Kitna, the Gators were in the market to bring in a transfer signal caller to serve as a bridge for Billy Napier’s second year while incoming freshman Jaden Rashada progresses into a game-ready option.
Playing at Wisconsin for four seasons — and serving as the Badgers' starting signal-caller in all three years — Mertz compiled 5,332 passing yards, 38 touchdowns and 26 interceptions on just under 60% completion.
The Gators believe they can maximize his skill set in their system.
His initial production projected an illustrious career with the Badgers, but he was unable to realize the expectations he set over his first few performances throughout his time in Madison, Wisc.
As a result, the Mission, Kan. native hit the open market this offseason looking for a fresh start. Napier and Co. presented that opportunity for him in Gainesville.
He took them up on the opportunity.
During his press conference on Wednesday, just before Mertz announced his commitment to Florida, Napier updated the standing of the quarterback position.
“There’s no question we anticipate adding a player in that room through the portal,” he said when asked about the state of the position. “We like to definitely have four scholarship players. We do intend to add a preferred walk-on as well in that room to give us five players for the spring and next year and really feel good about that situation.
“So, all those guys will be able to be here for the entire off-season program, which will be a big deal. But definitely anticipate taking another player.”
Mertz will likely compete with returning backup Jack Miller III and the true freshman Rashada for the starting quarterback spot next season. However, he enters as the favorite to earn the nod at the position at this early juncture.
Possessing talents as a true pocket passer, Mertz leaves a lot to be desired on the ground but showed the willingness to run the football when asked to do so at his previous stop.
That bodes well for Florida as they’ll look to complement a stout rushing attack by pushing the ball downfield in play-action concepts again next season.
He joins defensive lineman Caleb Banks as the only confirmed transfer into the Florida program, although more are expected in the coming weeks.

https://www.si.com/college/florida/recruiting/florida-gators-recruiting-welcome-2022-signee-tony-livingston,Florida Welcomes 2022 TE Signee Tony Livingston,"2022 Gators signee Tony Livingston was welcomed by Florida during the 2023 early signing period.
Tampa (Fla.) King 2022 tight end prospect Tony Livingston was given a special welcome on Wednesday evening as the first day of the early signing period reached its close. 
Livingston was included among the Gators' 22 class of 2023 signees and is expected to enroll at the university this offseason. 
While he was a member of Florida's signing class a year ago, Livingston took a grayshirt year and did enroll at UF as originally planned.
  Livingston originally committed to Florida under the Gators' previous coaching staff and was viewed as a developmental offensive lineman. First-year head coach Billy Napier thoroughly disagreed with that evaluation a year ago, however, due to Livingston's size upon signing.
Instead, when he does arrive on campus, Livingston is expected to be developed at the tight end position according to Napier's assessment of his skill set. 
""I think that Tony is an athlete,"" Napier said of Livingston in Dec. 2021. ""I think that certainly, we had to do a lot of research, right, in this situation. He's a fantastic basketball player, unique dimensions. This guy is 6-[foot]-4 and three-quarters, he's 225 pounds this weekend, and he's got [an] 11 [inch] hand. That's very unique. He's extremely long, and he's got a big frame.
""Now, he's a developmental player, right. I think he's got to work really hard this spring and certainly show up, but I think he's a unique athlete ... we're extremely excited about his potential.""
Livingston is the lone tight end signee in Florida's 2023 recruiting class to date.
