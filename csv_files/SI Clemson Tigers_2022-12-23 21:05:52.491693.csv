View the original article to see embedded media.

CLEMSON- Clemson added some talented youth, as well as some veteran experience to its quarterback room with its 2023 recruiting class.
While Cade Klubnik has yet to make a start and still has at least two years of eligibility left, the Tigers secured a commitment from blue-chip prospect Chris Vizzina back in the spring. 
The incoming freshman is arguably one of the five best players at the position, ranking No. 35 in the SI99, and Swinney thinks he already has his quarterback of the future.
""CV is a great, great player coming from Briarwood,"" the head coach said. ""I mean, he's a big-time talent, a guy that we think can go play for anybody in the country. I mean, he is a special player. Big, strong, can make all the throws, can really run. He's coming from a great program.""
Swinney also landed a QB out of the transfer portal. Paul Tyson, the great-grandson of the legendary coach Bear Bryant, was somewhat of a signing day surprise. The graduate transfer who started his career at Alabama before transferring to Arizona State last season was in for an unofficial visit last week, and on Wednesday, made it official by signing with the Tigers.
Clemson recruited Tyson coming out of high school, but he would ultimately sign with the Crimson Tide. While he doesn't have a ton of playing experience, he does provide a veteran presence in the quarterback room.
""Paul Tyson is a guy that we recruited a little bit in high school,"" Swinney said. ""One of the most prolific passers in the history of the state of Alabama coming out of high school. Three years in Tuscaloosa and then he spent this past year at Arizona State. And with Billy Wiles leaving, and obviously DJ leaving, we had a gap. So we needed to get a veteran guy.""
The Klubnik era might now be officially underway, but looking ahead to next season, the Tigers were lacking depth behind him on the depth chart, and with the additions of Vizzina and Tyler, Swinney feels the program has addressed its needs at quarterback.
""We obviously believe in Cade and who he is and what he we think he's going to do in our program and we see CV in that same light,"" Swinney said. ""So again, young guys, we don't have many guys.""
""We really needed somebody else to come in and kind of kind of give us a little more experience in the room, and so, Paul fits that.""

""What's wrong with a little bit of development? What's wrong with a little bit of time?""
Those are two of the questions Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney asked when he addressed the NCAA transfer portal process. 
Swinney never said he was against the portal, but the veteran coach believes the process that allows any player at any point in their career to leave one school and join another without any penalty to their eligibility should come with some ""tweaks"" to slow down ""hasty"" transfers.
""We all want this microwave (playing career). We need to have a crock pot mentality,"" Swinney said. ""The best meals come from that crock pot when you leave at about 8:00 in the morning and mama's got some food in the crockpot. You're like, oh, that's going to be good when I get home about 6:00, right? But everybody wants it in the microwave, and that's usually not the best meals, the one you just heat up.
""That's how everybody wants it to be.""
Instead of being in a hurry to find the right place or playing time, Swinney suggests taking an approach that he believes will help make getting a degree more important, protect high school recruits and curb one of college football's biggest issues. 
""I do think there should be some changes from the portal standpoint,"" Swinney said. ""I think right now a kid should, if your coach leaves, your head coach if he leaves or is fired, you ought to be able to go (to another school) and play wherever you want. I think that's great. I think if you're a graduate, you ought to be able to go and be eligible right away. You come to college to get a degree.  And you've earned that, but I think there just needs to be a few tweaks. 
""If you're not a graduate or your coach is not fired, you should have to sit a year, get acclimated because I think right now we have no barriers. We have no reason for pause. We have no pain, no consequences. If your coach is not fired or left or you're not a graduate, you sit a year. Then guess what? Upon graduation, you get that year back.""
Swinney said the superstars won't need the extra year anyway as they'll be heading to the NFL in three or four years anyway. 
""We would re-incentivize graduation, which is what we should be about in collegiate athletics,"" Swinney said. ""That's my opinion. I think that would (help graduation) if there was just a little bit of pause. It would cut back on some of these hasty decisions that kids make. You know, just a little bit of pause.""
Swinney thinks it would force players considering a transfer to push through a season that's not going their way and ""nine times out of 10, it works out for them."" A little bit of ""consequence"" would force players to make sure they really want to leave their current situation.
Another issue Swinney's plan would fix, he says, is tampering. Earlier this week, Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi and UNC coach Mack Brown publically said that big-time programs were offering current Tar Heel quarterback Drake Maye as much as $5 million to join another school. 
Maye isn't in the transfer portal and never has been. Neither head coach was so inclined to name the schools who made Maye offers, but it's not the first time accusations of other teams trying to poach players on a different roster have been made. It's supposed to be against NCAA rules, but it hasn't been enforced. 
""(Sitting out a year) would stop tampering because you got all this tampering going on out there because now there's this whole new pool of recruits, right? It's not healthy,"" Swinney said. ""It's not good for the game. It's not good for anybody and so it would cut out the tampering.  
""It would protect high school recruiting a little bit because again, you got a lot of these high school kids that aren't getting opportunities. I'm passionate about the high school kids and high school recruiting and development. You know, what do I know? I don't know. That's what I think.""

https://www.si.com/college/clemson/football/could-moving-early-signing-period-help-the-chaos,Could Moving Early Signing Period Help the Chaos?,"Dabo Swinney understands the NCAA needs to do something about the current state of college football.

View the original article to see embedded media.

CLEMSON, S.C. — Dabo Swinney has always been a fan of the Early Signing Period. He advocated for it for years.
However, Clemson’s head football coach also understands the NCAA needs to do something about the current state of college football.
Once conference championship weekend ends, college football is in a state of flux. Coaches are fired or leave for another job. The transfer portal opens, as thousands of players throw their names into the portal to see if the grass is greener on the other side.
Players decide whether or not to turn professional and opt of bowl games or the College Football Playoff. There are bowl games, bowl practices and press conferences going on and, oh by the way, there is recruiting and the early signing period.
For three weeks in December, it is chaos in college football. And though there is no one way to fix it, there is a way to possibly help it.
One way is to move the Early Signing Period to July or August.
“I guess there is a lot of conversation going on, but honestly, I love the early signing period. I have always been an advocate for it. I think it should be earlier,” Swinney said. “Personally, where we are today in college football, I think after August 1 of your senior year, you should be able to sign anytime you want.
“It is sad what is going on with high school recruiting. There are a lot of kids in high school that used to have a lot of opportunities and access that are not getting it now.”
Swinney said if he was a high school coach, he would move to push the Early Signing Period to the summer because it gives the high school players more protection.
“After August 1, if you offer someone a scholarship, that player ought to be able to sign,” he said. “That right there would protect these kids from all these fake offers. I think that is important.”
Where are these fake offers coming from?
As Swinney explains it, some coaches are offering an athlete a scholarship, but when a big-name player or a particular player puts his name into the transfer portal, these same coaches come back to these high school recruits and pull their offers so they can give it to someone they want from the transfer portal.
“So, it ought to be earlier, so those kids can lock into their school,” Swinney said. “All these guys that we had, they would have signed in June. They would have signed in July. They would have signed anytime.
“We just signed 26 high school kids and all 26 would have signed back in the summer. So, I think leave it where it is or move it earlier. Or just say, ‘Hey, anytime after August 1, you can sign.’ That would slow down these uncommittable offers, number one. 
“Number two, it protects the kids and I think it helps the coach as well.”
Swinney believes it can help the coaches because having a class signed at the end of a season, or in the middle of the season these days, will prevent athletic directors from being impatient and firing a coach after a few of years.
“Again, the kids are already protected and can leave at any time, but if that was the case and you can sign early, and they fire the coach or the coach leaves, then you are free to open your recruitment back up. I think that is important,” he said. “Maybe there will be some ADs out there that might give that coach another year. There is a really good class signed, committed already… that might give that guy another year or two.”
And that can help ease some of the chaos too.

The Clemson Tigers gave a first look as to what their squad will look like on December 30 when they take on the Tennessee Volunteers.
Notably, the Tigers starting quarterback is now true freshman Cade Klubnik, who earned the job after his stellar performance in the ACC Championship, and after the departure of former starter DJ Uiagaleleli to the transfer portal.
Also of note is Justin Mascoll getting the start a defensive end for Myles Murphy, and Wade Woodaz getting the start at linebacker for Trenton Simpson, as both Murphy and Simpson opted out.
Here is a look at the full depth chart:
Clemson is a 5.5-point favorite, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.

ATLANTA, Ga. – Behind two double-doubles from PJ Hall (Spartanburg, S.C./Dorman) and Hunter Tyson (Monroe, N.C./Piedmont), Clemson University men’s basketball rolled Georgia Tech on the road by a final score of 79-66.

Without the services of Alex Hemenway (Newburgh, Indiana/Castle) due to a foot injury, Hall and Tyson combined for 39 points and 23 rebounds. Hall posted a season-high 25 points and 10 rebounds, while Tyson totaled 14 points and 13 rebounds.
Chase Hunter (Atlanta, Ga./Westlake) and Brevin Galloway (Anderson, S.C./Seneca) both finished with 14 points each in the win.
With the Yellow Jackets (7-5, 0-2 ACC) leading 14-10 with 14:36 left in the first half, the Tigers engineered an 18-1 run over the next 8:17 to open up a double-digit lead and eventually a 40-26 advantage after the opening stanza.
Clemson didn’t let off the gas in the second half, opening up a game-high 23-point lead with 5:49 to play and ended up cruising to the 13-point victory.
The Tigers finished with 48 points in the paint and 20 assists on 32 made baskets.
Clemson will return to the floor on Friday, Dec. 30 when it hosts NC State at 4 p.m.

The Clemson Tiger fanbase has been snubbed twice, if not three times, by the Heisman voters. First, it was Deshaun Watson in 2015 and 2016, then it was Trevor Lawrence, who along with teammates single-handedly saved the 2020 season.The 2021 season started with former starting quarterback DJ Uigaleleli high on the odds makers list, however, he fell off almost before the season began. 
Now, the hopes of a Heisman Trophy lie with newly minted starting quarterback Cade Klubnik.
No. 3 for USA TODAY behind 2022 winner Caleb Williams and ACC player of the year Drake Maye.
""The hype machine has already kicked into gear after Klubnik replaced an ineffective DJ Uiagalelei in the ACC championship game against North Carolina and threw for 279 yards as the Tigers won easily,"" said USAT's Paul Myerberg. ""With Uiagalelei already in the portal, Klubnik will take over as the obvious starter and team up with star running back Will Shipley in what may be the best backfield in the country.""
ESPN named Klubnik as an up-and-comer for the award.
He was the No. 1 dual-threat QB in the class of 2022, and when, after weeks of speculation and expectation, he took over for the struggling DJ Uiagalelei in the ACC championship, he proceeded to obliterate North Carolina's defense, going 20-for-24 for 279 yards and a touchdown. He has all the tools, he has exciting young receivers (Antonio Williams, Beaux Collins, Cole Turner) and he has a workhorse back next to him in Will Shipley. No one would be surprised if he turned himself into a front-runner rather quickly,"" Bill Connelly wrote.

https://www.si.com/college/clemson/recruiting/drama-free-signing-day-nets-dabo-swinney-clemson-another-highly-touted-recruiting-class,"Drama-Free Signing Day Nets Dabo Swinney, Clemson Another Highly Touted Recruiting Class","Clemson signed 27 players on early signing day and head coach Dabo Swinney is confident that the Tigers have once again locked up one of the best classes in the country.
CLEMSON- There was no drama for Dabo Swinney on signing day this year.
The Tigers added 27 players on the first day of the signing period, with all but two having already been committed to the program. RB Jamarius Haynes and transfer QB Paul Tyler were the only two players to go public on Wednesday.
It's a class that ranked No. 9 in the country heading into signing day and one Swinney thinks will absolutely help his program in the future.
""It has been a great day,"" Swinney said. ""No drama, or anything like that. You got some of the best players in the country that have been committed for a long time and doing what they want to do. And would have signed back in the summer If you'd have let them. So it's just really, really cool for the day to finally get here, and they've been waiting on it.""
""This is my 14th signing class, and it's our 13th Top 15 class in a row. So like everything that we do in this program, we're incredibly consistent. We've been very consistent.""
However, Swinney is far more concerned about what the players do after arriving on campus than where the class might fall in the rankings.
""I always say time will tell as it does any, any signing class,"" Swinney said. ""Everybody gets excited about the signing class. I get a little more excited about what they do throughout their career. So time will tell with this class, just like it does every other class, but I really believe that this group will prove to be a very, very special group. I really believe that.""
Of the 27 signees, 16 are expected to enroll early, and it's a class that really focused on strengthening the team in the trenches. Clemson signed three blue-chip offensive linemen, as well as six blue-chip defensive linemen, the most in any one class since 2015, when the Tigers signed seven. DT Peter Woods and Vic Burley are two of the more prominent names, with both being SI99 players.
It also features Chris Vizzina, one of the top quarterback prospects in the country, as well as some talent at the skill positions.
""I think it's a group that's built in the trenches,"" Swinney said. ""We've got a lot of athleticism. We've got a bunch of skill on both sides. Another great quarterback coming in here. Just really excited about the whole group and how we put it together.""
In fact, Swinney thinks so highly of the class that the head coach is confident that this group will become the next to taste success, as each one of Clemson's recruiting classes since 2009 has won a championship of some kind.
""Every class that I've had, since February of '09, my first class, every single class- now that we've won the league this year- every single class has won a championship,"" he said. ""Which is part of what we want for everybody that comes to Clemson. So every single class has won a championship that's been here, or multiple, and I think without a doubt, this group will keep that going. So excited to get started with them, when that time comes.""

https://www.si.com/college/clemson/football/dabo-swinney-teases-return-of-draft-eligible-clemson-tigers,Swinney Teases Return of Draft-Eligible Tigers,"During his press conference for the early signing period, the Clemson head coach hinted that multiple Tigers who the staff thought would move on to the NFL are apparently sticking around for another season. But who?
Dabo Swinney let the cat out of the bag on Wednesday. 
Well, sort of. During his press conference for the early signing period, the Clemson head coach hinted that multiple Tigers who the staff thought would move on to the NFL are apparently sticking around for another season. 
""We've got some guys coming back that we didn't know were coming back that I promise you will be the best recruits in this class,"" Swinney said. ""I'm super excited about that. 
""There were some surprises to me. I don't know that y'all know about things. I don't know that some of them have said anything but at some point, they will."" 
So what does this mean? Who is on that list?
Right now, it's hard to say. Three defensive linemen with collegiate eligibility remaining - KJ Henry, Ruke Orhorhoro and Tyler Davis - have accepted invites to the Reese's Senior Bowl, a big NFL scouting event that takes place in early February. If they show up that week, that's declaring for the draft and they can't return to school. 
Davis said publically that he hasn't made a decision yet on his future. Defensive tackle Bryan Bresee, who has played in just 13 games combined the last two seasons, hasn't said yet if he's going pro or coming back to Clemson. 
Xavier Thomas, a senior defensive end who missed most of this year with a broken foot, has his redshirt season still available and could be a prime candidate to return. 
Defensive end Justin Mascoll, cornerback Sheridan Jones and receiver Joseph Ngata are all seniors with remaining eligibility who haven't announced their intentions. 
""We've got several guys that we thought would be leaving Clemson that are going to stay at Clemson,"" Swinney said. ""That's also a sign when you see guys could go ahead and go to the pros, all this stuff that's going on in college football, to chose to want to stay I think shows how they feel about Clemson, how they feel about their coaches and who we are as a program.""
Defensive end Myles Murphy and linebacker Trenton Simpson are the only two Tigers to announce that they are going pro. 
College players have until Jan. 16 to enter the 2023 NFL Draft. It's likely the public won't know who Swinney is referring to until after the No. 7 Tigers' Dec. 30 Orange Bowl game against No. 6 Tennessee.

Clemson has added some depth to its quarterback room via the transfer portal on signing day, as former Alabama and Arizona State quarterback Paul Tyson has announced he will play for the Tigers in 2023.
Tyson appeared in five games at Alabama in 2021, going 10-for-16 for 150 yards.
The 6-foot-5, 228-pound player was originally a member of the 2019 recruiting class and was widely considered one of the Top 10 pro-style quarterbacks in the country. 
Clemson has now gone to the portal in consecutive years to add depth to the quarterback room. Last season the Tigers signed Hunter Johnson.
Tyson, the great-grandson of legendary head coach Bear Bryant, will join Clemson as a graduate transfer and will have one year of eligibility remaining.
