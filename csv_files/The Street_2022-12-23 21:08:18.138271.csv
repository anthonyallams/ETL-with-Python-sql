https://www.thestreet.com/restaurants/taco-bell-menu-is-offering-a-new-value-deal,Taco Bell Menu Is Offering a New Value Deal,"Taco Bell's new Cravings Trios have already been tested in another part of the country last summer.
There are few things fast-food customers love more than a value deal -- Restaurant Brands International  (QSR) - Get Free Report's Burger King has frequently flip-flopped between selling the the 2 For $5 Your Way Deal and the 2 For $6 Your Way Deal to much customer mirth while many are still angry at privately-held Subway for nixing the $5 footlong that has been around since 2003.
Another chain known for its combo boxes and ""cravings packs,"" Yum! Brands  (YUM) - Get Free Report-owned Taco Bell this year launched a $5 breakfast box with a Grande Toasted Breakfast Burrito, hash browns, two Cinnabon Delights donut holes and a warm drink and has also long had a daytime $5 box with a burrito, taco, chips with nacho sauce and a soft drink.
In general, $5 has been shaping up to be the dividing line between what customers consider to be a good deal and a regular menu item. But it's a price point that we now see less and less often as food inflation puts pressure on the chains.
At Taco Bell specifically, the average menu item got 14.6% more expensive in the last year -- from an average $2.94 in September 2021 to $3.37 in October 2022.
But even as many chains raise prices, deals and promotions are still important for maintaining customer interest. In Ohio, Taco Bell has been spotted testing three new $6 promotions -- each one features a main item like the Mexican Pizza, Crunchwrap Supreme or Cheesy Gordita Crunch with a Doritos Locos Tacos and a medium-size fountain drink.
The same ""Cravings Trios"" were tested in Omaha, Nebraska as $5 promotions last summer but the cost of raw ingredients like beef has gone up since then.
In Ohio, the promotion is known as the $6 Cravings Trio and will be available at a selection of Columbus locations to test whether such a deal would be worth bringing to the rest of the country.
Despite raising prices (the average Wendy's  (WEN) - Get Free Report menu item now costs over 30% more than it did in 2021), fast-food chains have seen no shortage of customers. That's partly because people who may have previously gone to pricier restaurants increasingly look for cheaper options. 
For low-income families, fast food has also long been a way to get a hot meal cheaper than it would cost to buy individual ingredients.
A few months ago, Placer.ai calculated that while overall restaurant visits fell 7.6% in July and 13.7% in August, traffic to McDonald's  (MCD) - Get Free Report and Chipotle  (CMG) - Get Free Report increased by a respective 4.7% and 3.1%.
In a summer earnings call, Chipotle chief executive Brian Niccol said that higher-income customers were coming into its stores more frequently and ordering more sides and add-ons while lower-income customers were also coming in but largely ordering one entrée with some of the less expensive proteins.
""What we saw was probably not all that different from what people have been saying,"" Niccol told analysts and investors. ""The low income consumer definitely has pulled back their purchase frequency. Fortunately, for Chipotle, that is not the majority of our customers.""",TheStreet,"Economy, Retail, Investing, Restaurants, Inflation, Food & drink, Food & staples retail",Veronika bondarenko,"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 19:32:33 GMT",Taco Bell's new Cravings Trios have already been tested in another part of the country last summer.,https://www.thestreet.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg5MjIwNjA1Nzg1MDI0NDAz/taco-bell.jpg
https://www.thestreet.com/housing/buying-selling-home-tough-in-2023-realtor-com,'A Nobody's Market'; Buying or Selling a Home Tough in '23: Realtor.com,"'The 2023 housing market could become a nobody’s-market, not friendly to buyers or to sellers,' it said.
This year has been a tough one for the housing market, with home sales falling for most of the year. 
And next year may not be much better, whether you’re looking to buy or sell a home, according to Realtor.com.
“After being overwhelmed in the housing frenzy of the recent past, homeowners, sellers, buyers, and renters may be underwhelmed in 2023,” Danielle Hale, Realtor.com’s chief economist, wrote in a commentary.
“The slowdown in home-sales transactions that began as mortgage rates surged in 2022 is expected to continue, leading to a moderation in home-price growth and tipping housing-market balance away from sellers.”
Existing-home sales dropped 7.7% in November from October, marking the 10th straight monthly decline, according to the National Association of Realtors. November sales were down 35.4% from a year earlier.
The median existing-home price slid 2.2% to $370,700 in November from October. That was up 3.5% from a year earlier. The price peaked at a record of $413,800 in June. 
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 6.27% in the week ended Dec. 22, more than double the 3.02% rate of a year earlier, according to Freddie Mac.
This obviously hasn’t been good news for home buyers, and they can’t expect much relief next year, Hale said.
“With mortgage rates continuing to climb as the Fed navigates the economy to a softish landing, a moderation in home-price growth will not be enough for the housing market to be a buyer’s bonanza,” she said. 
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by 4.25 percentage points since March, and many experts expect it to go another 0.75 percentage point early next year.
To be sure, “home shoppers will enjoy advantages such as a growing number of homes for sale,” Hale said. “But costs will remain high, challenging affordability at a time when overall budgets continue to be squeezed.”
Home inventories totaled  1.14 million units at the end of November, up 2.7% from a year earlier, according to the NAR. Unsold inventory stood at a 3.3-month supply on Nov. 30 at the current sales pace, unchanged from October but up from 2.1 months in November 2021.
So both buyers and sellers are in a bit of a pickle, Hale said.
“If home shoppers and sellers have unrealistic expectations, they could find themselves in a stalemate in the year ahead,” she said. 
“The 2023 housing market could become a nobody’s-market, not friendly to buyers or to sellers. Consumers who are ready for the challenge will need up-to-date information on market conditions, creativity and flexibility to adjust, and a healthy dose of patience in order to create success.”",TheStreet,"Real estate, Interest rates, Personal finance, Housing, Real estate, Personal finance, Housing market",Dan weil,"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 19:29:46 GMT","'The 2023 housing market could become a nobody’s-market, not friendly to buyers or to sellers,' it said.",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMjQ2ODIzMjU5MDIyNjc4/residential-homes12.jpg
https://www.thestreet.com/commodities/gasoline-prices-are-heading-up-again,Gasoline Prices Are Heading Up Again,"The recent rebound in oil prices have pushed gasoline prices higher for the holiday season.
Consumers who were counting on gasoline prices to fall to $2.99 a gallon won't get their wish in time for Christmas because of a second week of gains in crude oil prices.
The recent increase in crude oil prices also pushed gasoline prices higher. Crude oil prices have risen lately and jumped by at least $2 a barrel on Dec. 23 when Russia moved to lower its output of crude oil due to the price cap instituted by the G7 countries on Moscow's exports.
The Russians said they could slash output from 5% to 7% early next year due to the caps in prices, according to the RIA news agency that quoted Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak on Dec. 23.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the U.S. benchmark for oil prices, rose to trade at $78.22, up by 2.88% mid-day on Dec. 23. The price of Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, jumped to $84.39, an increase of 3.33%.
Drivers who were expecting gasoline prices to fall to $2.99 a gallon will not see gas stations selling at that level for awhile.
""Not looking like we’ll get to $2.99- oil gas rallied and that’s putting an end to the decline for now,"" Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis, GasBuddy, a Boston-based provider of retail fuel pricing information and data, told TheStreet.
""That’s it for now, folks,"" he tweeted. ""It looks like the national average price of gasoline will bottom just shy of $2.99, thx to the recent rally in oil markets.""
Gasoline prices could fall to below $2.75 a gallon over the next few days, but the national average ""should stay in this ballpark for a bit,"" De Haan tweeted.
The Arctic blast occurring in most of the U.S. except for states such as California and Nevada and even stretching to Florida, will not impact gasoline prices.
Refineries located in states such as Texas, which are experiencing frigid temperatures such as 25 degrees in Pasadena (near Houston), could be impacted on a short-term basis. The colder weather is expected to last only until Dec. 26 when the low is estimated to be 33 degrees with a high of 59 degrees in Pasadana where some of the refineries are located. Other refineries are located in adjacent towns -  Deer Park, Texas City and Baytown.
""There could be impacts to refineries in extremely cold temps, but it is unlikely to have impact on prices,"" De Haan said.
While demand typically rises during Christmas and the new year, storms throughout the U.S. have cancelled plans for many travelers, especially those flying to their destinations. Thousands of flights have been cancelled the past two days along with dozens of disruptions on Amtrak, the rail service
The blizzard conditions in the Midwest in cities such as Detroit, Chicago and Minneapolis-St. Paul have made travel hazardous and nearly impossible.
The demand in gasoline use has risen slightly - the EIA reported an increase of demand to 8.71 millon barrels per day (mbpd). That amount is ""just a bit above the rise GasBuddy data"" reported earlier in the week.
""According to GasBuddy data, weekly (Sun-Sat) US gasoline demand rose 3.2% from the prior week and was 1.5% above the four week average. We model consumption at 8.63mbpd,"" De Haan tweeted on Dec. 18.
The amount of demand by consumers is similar to what consumers used in 2021.
""Last year also saw similar metrics, for the same week in 2021, we saw +2.9% WoW and +1.2% vs four week average,"" he said in a tweet.

https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/will-cathie-woods-arkk-fund-bottom-this-year-check-the-chart,Will Cathie Wood’s ARKK Fund Bottom This Year? Check the Chart.,"Cathie Wood's ARKK fund is now down more than 80% from its high. Here's what the charts look like now.
It hasn’t been this bad for growth stocks in 20 years, since the dot-com boom and bust. 
If the ARK Innovation ETF  (ARKK) - Get Free Report was around then, it would have likely experienced moves similar to the ones we’re seeing today.
The fund's shares are now trading below the 2020 covid low of $33, as the ETF is now down more than 80% from its peak. That’s brutal.
For what it’s worth, the Nasdaq Composite suffered a peak-to-trough decline of 78.4% and the Invesco QQQ ETF  (QQQ) - Get Free Report fell 84% during the dot-com bust.
While the market surely has ebbed and flowed over the past two decades, those moves have been more extreme for growth stocks. That’s just how it is.
When the Fed is accommodative and the economy is strong, growth stocks rip and valuations struggle to hold the stock prices in check. 
But when the Fed is tightening with a restrictive monetary policy and the economy is weakening, growth stocks fail miserably. 
The main reason? They don’t have the profits or cash flow to support their stock prices like some of the more well-established businesses out there. 
The growth stocks that do have profits can be evaluated on an earnings basis, but just like a bull market in reverse, valuation does little to support the stock prices in a bear market.
With all that in mind, let’s look at the leading growth-stock proxy in the market, which is the ARKK ETF. 
Chart courtesy for TrendSpider.com
Three of ARKK’s four largest holdings — Tesla  (TSLA) - Get Free Report, Roku  (ROKU) - Get Free Report and Zoom Video  (ZM) - Get Free Report — made new 52-week lows on Thursday. So, not surprisingly, did ARKK. 
But the technicals provide a reason to believe that ARKK may be near some sort of trough. ARKK might in fact bottom before the calendar hits 2023. 
But still the trends are not very supportive of that theory, unless we get a much larger rotation to the upside.
That starts by the stock reclaiming $33 and the declining 10-week moving average on the chart above. At the very least, that will put ARKK above active resistance (the 10-week) and back above a key level (the covid low and recent support).
Depending on the strength of the rally, that could put the 50-week and 10-month moving averages in play, along with the $50 to $52 area. 
Chart courtesy of trendSpider.com
What happens if ARKK can’t reclaim $33? Or worse, if it becomes resistance? 
On the monthly chart, one can see the clean break of $33 so far in December. If ARKK reclaims this level, traders could have a reversal to work with, but so long as it’s below $33, the bulls must be careful. 
Ultimately, it could open the door down to the $22 to $22.50 area. I know it seems extreme — it would equate to an 86% peak-to-trough decline — but that’s where ARKK could land if the selling pressure hits an extreme level. 
The bottom line: Keep an eye on $33 and the 10-week moving average. ",TheStreet,"Investing, Technical analysis, Stocks, Trading, Markets, Asset manager, Investing, Stocks, Technology",Bret kenwell,"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 19:00:11 GMT",Cathie Wood's ARKK fund is now down more than 80% from its high.

https://www.thestreet.com/lifestyle/travel/disney-world-brings-back-legendary-ride-hints-at-major-opening,"Disney World Brings Back Legendary Ride, Hints at Major Opening","A nostalgic attraction has been closed at Disney World while enabling the construction of a thrilling new feature.
When you make plans to visit Walt Disney World, it's always a good idea to check which attractions are scheduled to be open and which are closed while you are visiting.
A prospective Disney  (DIS) - Get Free Report guest making a trip to the theme park, only to find an attraction they are looking forward to experiencing is not open, can feel a bit of disappointment. It's an expensive trip, so you want to get as much bang for your buck as you can.
Ever since Disney World opened in Orlando in 1971, the company has been remodeling and revitalizing its attractions. The changes are part of a strategy by Founder Walt Disney, who understood that the parks would always need to be reinvented to remain attractive destinations to new and returning guests.
In general, the best time for renovations is after peak tourism season in the summer. The chilliest two months in central Florida are January and February, which are often the periods of fewest visitors and are consequently prime times for facelifts and maintenance.
Scheduling such overhauls is a major undertaking because much of the park still needs to remain open to adequately entertain guests during those months. Closing some attractions temporarily means that during those downtimes other attractions  get more patrons.
But sometimes, on rare occasion, an attraction is unavailable for not just a few weeks or months, but years.
After being closed for more than four years, the Walt Disney Railroad is officially open again, the company said on Dec. 23.
It was out of commission for so long because its route was interrupted by the construction of a major new attraction.
""Listen to the clamor of the engine, the chug of the wheels and the call of the whistle as you travel aboard the Walt Disney World Railroad,"" the company writes on its website. ""Take your seat on one of four meticulously restored, vintage narrow-gauge steam trains -- originally built between 1916 and 1928 -- and enjoy a relaxing 20-minute, 1.5-mile scenic round-trip tour.""
The Walt Disney World Railroad was active on the day the park opened on Oct. 1, 1971. It had only one stop at the time. Other stops have been added periodically.
The railroad runs four trains. Disney bought the locomotives in 1969 and restored them for use at the park.
Disney
The new attraction that held up  the train's runs for more than four years was the construction of Tron Lightcycle / Run, a new roller coaster now scheduled to open this spring.
The ride is based on the 1982 Disney film ""Tron,"" the first production of its kind to mix live action with computer-generated visuals and backlit animation, according to Disney.
""Lean forward into the ultimate race of survival!"" writes the company on its website. ""Leave the real world behind and join Team Blue in an epic quest across the Grid -- the dark, computerized world with no horizons from Tron.""
The roller coaster is modeled after the existing one at the company's Shanghai property and will be one of the fastest at any Disney theme park in the world.",TheStreet,"Retail, Entertainment, Lifestyle, Travel, Travel",Jeffrey quiggle,"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 18:52:36 GMT",A nostalgic attraction has been closed at Disney World while enabling the construction of a thrilling new feature.,https://www.thestreet.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg4NDMwNTk3Mjg1NDg3Nzc5/disney-world-parade.jpg
https://www.thestreet.com/taxes/five-last-minute-tax-deductions,Five Last-Minute Tax Deductions,"The end of the calendar year is a great time to lock in tax deductions.
2022 has been a bumpy ride for Americans, with a roiling economy, angst over viruses, surging numbers of layoffs, a lackluster stock market,, and a general downward tilt in consumer confidence.
Weary U.S. adults may not be in the mood for it, but the end of the year represents a good time to get some of that mojo back in the form of cash-saving tax deductions. 2022 has also been a year of change for the Internal Revenue Service, with new rules and allowances in place ushered in by Congress and by the IRS over the course of the past 12 months.
“There have been significant changes in how Americans file their taxes for the 2022 tax year,” said Taxfyle co-founder Richard Lavina. “Much of that relates to the rampant inflation we faced this year.”
To account for rising inflation, the IRS increased the standard deduction for tax filers. 
For the 2022 tax year, married couples who claim the standard deduction will receive $25,900, while single filers can claim a standard deduction of $12,950, and heads of household receive a standard deduction of $19,400. 
“The IRS also adjusted the income thresholds on long-term capital gains tax rates and tax brackets to try to make up for the price rise we’ve felt,” Lavina said. “Many changes to tax credits were adjusted to pre-pandemic levels.”
Take These Tax Deductions at Year-End
With change in the air and with an ongoing need for household savings in play after a tough year, why not use IRS rules – new and old – to save some money heading into the new year?
Tax experts note these end-of-the-year deductions that may take the sting out of a taxing 2022.
Sell off any losing investments. 2022 was a rough year for the stock market, with the S&P 500 Index down 20% for the year in late December. 
Make amends by selling any portfolio losers and lock in a tax gain.
“If your stocks are at a loss right now, sell them before year end and take the deduction,” advised tax specialist Kara Dennis. “Also sell if you have crypto losses. In that event, sell your crypto to create a taxable event and take advantage of the losses.”
Other tax experts concur.
“Loss harvesting can help offset capital gains or get up to $3,000 to offset other income,” said Delagify Financial certified financial planner Robert Persichitte.
Tax planning around retirement accounts. It’s a good idea to maximize your 401(k) or IRA plans at year-end.
“Some employers will let you contribute up to 100% of your paycheck, “Persichitte said. “Be careful if you try this, though. You'll likely need to write your employer a check to pay for benefits if that's the case.”
Home office deductions. If you’re self-employed and use part of your home as office space for your business, you can deduct a certain amount of tax from your rent, mortgage interest, utilities, or insurance. 
“However, it's important to note that this is only applicable if you are self-employed, if you work from home but have an employer, this doesn’t apply to you,” said Top Dollar founder and former Wall Street trader Josh Dudick. “The amount of tax you can deduct will also depend on the amount of space you use in your home for an office. The more space you have, the more you can deduct, within reason and limits.”
Additionally, if you’re self-employed, you can deduct any business insurance premiums or health insurance premiums from your tax returns. “The health insurance premiums count for yourself, your spouse, children under 27, or any dependents on your premium,” Dudick said.
Take advantage of expanded tax deductions. Deduction allowances for certain tax categories have been expanded for 2022.
“For example, the annual gift tax exemption goes to $17,000 and the state and gift tax exemption goes to $12,920,000,” said Fiske & Company principal Fred Freifeld. “Additionally, maximum contributions to 401(k) plans goes to $22,500. If you’re 50 years old or more it goes to $30,000.”",TheStreet,"Cryptocurrency, Investing, Stocks, Personal finance, Taxes, Taxes, Personal finance, Money basics",Brian o'connell,"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 18:50:40 GMT",The end of the calendar year is a great time to lock in tax deductions.,https://www.thestreet.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNDY3NzI0MjcyNjc0MTE4/filing-taxes-4-js-092022.jpg
https://www.thestreet.com/technology/elon-musk-continues-to-warn-about-a-huge-mistake,Musk Continues to Warn About a Decision Hurting the Economy,"The serial entrepreneur believes that the monetary policy has caused enormous damage to the economy.
The deterioration of the economic climate has been one of the main concerns for investors for several months now. 
This is reflected in particular in the fall of nearly 33% of the Nasdaq 100 stock market index, dominated by technology companies which are mainly growth stocks.
Price increases for goods and services are at their highest in 40 years in many Western countries, forcing central banks to raise interest rates, which makes access to credit expensive.
In the United States, many economists believe that the aggressive rise in interest rates will cause the economy's so-called hard landing, aka a recession. The tech sector tends to perform well when the economy is healthy and confidence is high.
Consumers tend to spend on tech products and services when things are going well. But as soon as the economic situation deteriorates, they begin to be cautious, favoring necessary purchases, often to the detriment of tech.
To understand investor anxiety, just look at the performance of Big Tech stocks. Shares of social media giant Meta Platforms  (META) - Get Free Report have fallen 65.2% this year and shares of Tesla  (TSLA) - Get Free Report are down a steep 64.4% at the time of writing. Amazon  (AMZN) - Get Free Report shares fell 49.7%, while Alphabet  (GOOGL) - Get Free Report shares fell 39.4%. Shares of software giant Microsoft  (MSFT) - Get Free Report fell 28.2%, while shares of iPhone maker Apple  (AAPL) - Get Free Report fell 25.1%.
""My advice to people, small business owners is take some risks off the table. If you are going to make a purchase maybe slow down that purchase a little bit,"" Amazon founder Jeff Bezos advised last November. ""If you are an individual and you are thinking about buying a new large screen TV maybe slow that down keep that cash, see what happens. Same thing with a refrigerator, a new car whatever, let’s take some risks off the table.""
For many economists and business leaders the situation would never have become so desperate if the Federal Reserve had been less aggressive in raising interest rates. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is among the critics of the central bank. 
The tech mogul has been repeating, for several months now, that the Fed should stop raising interest rates immediately, to avoid causing lasting damage to the economy. 
He has just renewed this warning once again, and goes further in estimating that this monetary policy will be remembered as one of the most devastating for economic activity.
""The Fed has never raised rates faster,"" a Twitter user posted on December 22. ""We are all test subjects in a massive economic experiment.""
Musk seized the opportunity to blast the Fed.
""At the risk of being repetitive, these Fed rate increases might go down in history as most damaging ever,"" the billionaire said. 
He was then asked what he would do if he were the Fed but did not answer.
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates sharply in recent months, taking the benchmark rate from almost zero during the pandemic to a range between 4.25% and 4.5%, in an effort to combat inflation, which is at its highest in 40 years. This is the highest level since 2008.
The so-called Dot Plots, which illustrate the views of the Fed's eighteen member rate-setting committee, indicate a terminal Fed Funds rate of around 5.1% by the spring, a level that it plans to hold until the end of the year. 
The CEO of electric vehicle maker Tesla believes that a continued rise in rates will cause deflation, a risk already indicated by Musk last September. The consequences of deflation can be devastating for the economy because the fall in prices encourages households to postpone purchasing decisions while waiting for further price declines. 
This in turn can lead to a drop in overall consumption and an increase in inventories at companies, which can no longer sell their products. In response, they reduce production and investment.
Musk has been quick in recent weeks to attribute Tesla's stock market rout to the Fed actions despite shareholder pushback.
""I keep saying that Fed rate is insane, because data I’m seeing says we’re already in deflation. If true, then real rate of return of T-bills is roughly that of S&P500. Very smart investor I spoke to today said he’s shorting S&P…"" the billionaire said as recently as December 21.
Two weeks prior, he blamed the Fed again for Tesla's woos: ""Macro conditions are difficult: energy in Europe, real estate in China & crazy Fed rates in USA.""",TheStreet,"Electric vehicles, Tesla, Economy, Elon musk, Technology, Automotive, Energy, Cars, Federal reserve, Interest rates, Technology, Transportation, Investing",Luc olinga,"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 17:31:36 GMT",The serial entrepreneur believes that the monetary policy has caused enormous damage to the economy.,https://www.thestreet.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg4NzYwNTI4NjE5ODQxMDU2/elon-musk_4.jpg
https://www.thestreet.com/automotive/your-car-probably-uses-parts-made-with-forced-labor-report-says,Your Car Probably Uses Parts Made With Forced Labor: Report Says,"Researchers find auto supply chains lead back to Uyghur region controlled by China, where human rights abuses are rampant.
A recent report regarding forced Uyghur labor in China -- and its relationship to parts for products made by the world's major auto manufacturers -- is stirring calls for investigations.
The study concludes that anyone who has purchased a new car in the past five years may well be driving a vehicle with parts made by people forced to work in China.
The investigation that revealed these links was conducted by researchers at Sheffield Hallam University in the UK.
""Consumers do not want cars made through exploitation,"" the report report noted. ""But a combination of weak enforcement of forced labour laws and the government’s blind eye to environmental standards in China, paired with convoluted supply chains has left the automotive industry reliant on abusive suppliers.""
Companies implicated include nearly every major car brand, according to the study. Among the named brands are Honda  (HMC) - Get Free Report, Ford  (F) - Get Free Report, General Motors  (GM) - Get Free Report, Toyota  (TM) - Get Free Report and Tesla  (TSLA) - Get Free Report.
The published research explains how the Chinese government has moved auto parts manufacturing into the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, which means international supply chains are at risk of using parts and materials created through systematic forced labor.
""In a six-month investigation undertaken by Laura T. Murphy, Kendyl Salcito, Yalkun Uluyol, Mia Rabkin, and a team of anonymous researchers, analysis of publicly available documents revealed massive and expanding links between western car brands and Uyghur abuses, in everything from the hood decals and car frames to engine casings, interiors and electronics,"" the Helena Kennedy Centre for International Justice report said.
The report has had a ripple effect through human rights organizations and individuals calling for action, particularly with regard to the need for auto manufacturers to investigate steps in their supply chains.
""The auto industry cannot wait another day to trace their supply chains back to the raw materials,"" the researchers concluded. ""To do anything short of full tracing would be an enormous legal, ethical, and reputational risk.""
A Senate inquiry is reportedly in the works and people are reacting.
""The US Senate Finance Committee has asked automakers including @Tesla and @GM to detail their supply chains in light of @LauraTMurphy and her team's report on Uyghur forced labor in car manufacturing. So inspiring to see the impact a report can have!"" wrote Corporate Accountability Lab in a tweet.
""Thank you to @RonWyden and the @SenFinance Committee for opening an inquiry into the use of #Uyghur forced labor in the auto industry. @Tesla, @GM, and other auto manufacturers must ensure their supply chains are ethically sourced,"" tweeted Jewish World Watch.
""In a letter sent Thursday, the committee asked the chief executives of 8 car manufacturers for information on their supply chains, to help determine links to #Xinjiang, where the U.S. has alleged the use of forced labor involving #Uyghurs and others,"" tweeted Tom Hayes as @kabiu.

https://www.thestreet.com/investing/oakmark-fund-manager-oracle-value-stocks,"Oracle, Other Value Stocks Are Picks From Oakmark Fund Manager","Oakmark's Robert Bierig says value stocks, including the ones in his funds, can flourish in the current market environment.
Robert Bierig, a manager of Oakmark Fund and Oakmark Select Fund, sees the current stock-market environment as constructive for value stocks, including the ones in his funds.
The spread between companies with high price-earnings multiples and companies with low ones is bigger than usual, he noted. 
That puts value investors in the catbird seat because it means there may be more opportunity than usual in low P-E stocks.
When looking at growth investing versus value investing, Bierig views all intelligent investing as value investing. And growth is an important component of value, he says.
He cites Oracle and five other stocks among his favorites. Here are his comments.
Street.com: What’s your philosophy in choosing stocks?
Bierig: We’re fundamental research-based value investors. We take a private-equity approach to investing in the public markets.
Our philosophy is based on three principles. First, we seek to buy stocks at a discount to our estimate of intrinsic business value. Second, we look for companies that we expect to grow per-share value over the long-term. Third, we want management teams that think and act like owners, so they’ll be good stewards of investment capital.
Street.com: What are two stocks your funds hold that you like a lot?
Bierig: One stock we like today is Oracle  (ORCL) - Get Free Report. Like many names in software, the stock is down this year. It’s about 25% off its December 2021 high.
Oracle is going through two cloud transitions at the same time. This complexity has obscured the underlying progress that the business has been making.
In applications, Oracle’s strategic back-office cloud business is growing annualized revenue 25% to 30% in constant currency. In infrastructure, Oracle’s cloud services and autonomous database are growing even faster.
As these next-generation businesses become a larger percentage of total revenue, Oracle’s overall revenue growth rate is accelerating close to double-digits after many years of flattish results. 
The company also has opportunities to drive faster growth and substantially higher margins from its recent acquisition of Cerner. 
Finally, Oracle has reduced its share count nearly 50% in the last decade through buybacks. At only around 12 times our estimate of normal earnings excluding cash, we think this is a cheap stock. 
Another stock that we like is CBRE  (CBRE) - Get Free Report. The company earns a toll on commercial real estate activity in the U.S. and is the largest player in the industry.
CBRE benefits from an increase in institutional ownership of real estate as well as from an increase in the toll it can charge for its services. It consistently gains share in leasing and capital markets and grows its outsourcing business as it takes over commercial real estate operations for large corporate clients. 
However, the stock price is down roughly 30% year to date. Investors are understandably concerned about higher interest rates and an economic slowdown that could lead to a pause in transaction activity. 
We have always anticipated a slowdown but expect trough earnings to be higher than feared, due to a shift toward outsourcing and more recurring revenue streams in recent years. We view the stock as attractive at around 11 times our estimate of mid-cycle earnings.

TheStreet.com: What’s your outlook for the stock market as a whole next year?
Bierig: We tend to avoid making predictions about how the stock market might perform in a given year. But I will say that the current mid-teens multiple on the S&P 500 is not extreme in either direction relative to history. 
What is unusual today is that the spread between companies with high price-earnings ratios and companies with low ones is wider than is typically the case. That’s a good setup for stock pickers to add value because it means there may be more opportunity than usual in low P-E stocks.
TheStreet.com: Where do you think buying opportunities will be?
Bierig: We’re finding a number of good businesses that are out of favor today, including the two I just mentioned. 
In addition, we’re seeing bargains in financials, where we own banks selling at less than half the S&P 500 P-E multiple. Examples include Wells Fargo  (WFC) - Get Free Report and Capital One Financial  (COF) - Get Free Report.
These banks trade at discounts to tangible book value and have been returning capital to shareholders. We have added to our investments in these longstanding holdings this year.
We’re also identifying opportunities in the energy sector, where we own exploration and production companies selling at double-digit free-cash-flow yields. Examples include EOG Resources  (EOG) - Get Free Report and ConocoPhillips  (COP) - Get Free Report.
The financials and the energy companies are not necessarily great businesses, but we think they can be excellent investments at current prices.
Street.com: What do you think about growth vs value going forward?
Bierig: I think all intelligent investing is value investing. We’re trying to buy a piece of a business for less than it’s worth. The growth rate is a component of the value, and it’s an important one.
When P-E multiples are compressed, high growth companies tend to be cheap relative to the opportunity set. When P-E multiples are more dispersed, as they are today, we think more traditional value names tend to be attractive.
Street.com: Do you think index funds will continue to gain market share against active funds?
Bierig: I think there’s a place for both index funds and active funds. When selecting an active fund, though, it’s important to make sure you’re not inadvertently investing in a closet indexer. In that case, you’re likely to underperform net of fees. 
Instead, I’d suggest looking for active managers who build their portfolios based on conviction rather than benchmark weightings and who hold their stocks for longer than is typical – i.e., at least a few years.

https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/too-early-to-buy-amd-charts-provide-clues-for-traders,Too Early to Buy AMD? Charts Provide Clues.,"AMD stock filled the gap and is trying to find support. Here is the trade now.
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices  (AMD) - Get Free Report have been struggling, and the bulls are hoping the stock soon finds its footing.
The shares are down four weeks in a row, a streak AMD stock can snap with a 2.4% rally on Friday. 
On Thursday, the stock was down 8% at one point and closed lower by 5.6%. The earnings reaction from Micron  (MU) - Get Free Report didn’t seem to help matters, nor did the broader market decline. 
A few observations regarding  AMD: 
-- Tech stocks remain in a bear market, with each rally being sold. 
-- AMD continues to lag Nvidia  (NVDA) - Get Free Report when it comes to stock performance. 
-- The Fed is leading the hawkish chorus among global central banks, as they continue to tighten their policies. That’s not only negative for stocks but seems likely to be pushing us toward a recession. 
None of those observations are bullish for AMD stock, even if the shares are becoming attractive on a valuation basis.

The stock at one point lost nearly half its value, dropping to $55 from $105. It found support just below the prior breakout level at $59 and the 21-quarter moving average.
With yesterday’s flush, AMD stock filled the gap at $63 and found support near the 61.8% retracement. Now it’s once again trying to find its footing, and the bulls are hopeful for a bounce. 
They may get one, but until AMD stock can clear the 10-day and 50-day moving averages, it may be nothing more than that — a bounce.
Currently, AMD stock doesn’t appear able to sustain an uptrend until it reclaims those key measures.
If it can clear those levels and close above the $70 to $72 area, then $80 is back in play, along with the 200-day moving average.

Longer term, the trend still looks precarious for the bulls. 
The shares momentarily reclaimed the $73 to $74 area, which was previous support over the past several years. 
While the daily chart is more nuanced than the weekly, the latter seems to suggest another test of the $59 area and the 21-quarter moving average. 
If selling pressure persists, the low near $54.50 is likely in play, followed by $50. ",TheStreet,"Technical analysis, Semiconductors & semiconductor equipment, Stocks, Markets, Stocks, Investing, Advanced micro devices, Investing, Trading",Bret kenwell,"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 17:07:38 GMT",AMD stock filled the gap and is trying to find support.
