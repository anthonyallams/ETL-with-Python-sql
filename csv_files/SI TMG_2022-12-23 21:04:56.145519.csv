https://www.si.com/college/tmg/mark-blaudschun/charlie-baker-ncaa,A Jersey Guy: Baker could be right choice,"It took Charlie Baker less than a day to focus on the key to success in his new job as President of the NCAA.
The out-going Massachusetts governor, who will officially replace Mark Emmert in March, spent much of his day in zoom conferences with the real power brokers of college athletics--the conference commissioners.
The problems facing the NCAA in college football and to a lesser extent in college basketball are wide spread and expanding.
Lack of direction by the NCAA in football and a failure to grasp hold of the new trends of Names, Image and Licensing and the transfer portal has turned big time college athletics into its perception: An out of control, money-grabbing entity, driven by one prime factor: money, money, money.
And we are talking BILLION dollar operations in basketball, where the NCAA tournament known as March Madness is a cash cow which feeds the entire membership and in football, which now resembles an outlaw community, basically leadership, where the rules of engagement with few consequences.
Added to this mixture is the political nature of the new look of major college athletics which is an NFL and NBA lite level of competition. Any talk of ""amateurism'' and student-athlete'' should be left at the FCS and Division II and III level.
Emmert, for a variety of reasons, has left the NCAA in a strong financial situation, but in chaos in almost all other areas.
  And the key element to success right now is familiar with the political geography.
Baker, as a two term REPUBLICAN governor, who maintained his popular status in a Democratic state, knows how to do this.
He is also a much better ""people'' person than Emmert ever has been or can be.
""It's big and its complicated,'' conceded Baker last week when the announcement that he was the new NCAA president was made.. """"So have been a lot of things in my life, but most of the time, they were absolutely worth doing.''
 Baker does not have to fiddle much with college basketball. 
March Madness is arguably one of the greatest events in all sports.
Football is on the cusp of moving into another level with a 12-team playoff system.
The NCAA has backed or sprinted away from having anything to do with FBS football and it will remain in the background.
But Charie Baker can help by getting the Power 5 commissioners to get on the same page. If that happens, order will be re-stored and the sport can move into its next phase.
Saving the NCAA is worth doing for a variety of reasons.
There is nothing to suggest Charie Baker can't do that job.",TMG Sports,Mark-blaudschun,Mark blaudschun,"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 19:41:58 GMT","It took Charlie Baker less than a day to focus on the key to success in his new job as President of the NCAA.

https://www.si.com/college/tmg/mark-blaudschun/coaching-descriptions-leach,A Jersey Guy: Leach was almost an iconic CFB fixture,"The death of Mississippi State football coach Mike Leach has diminished the sport far beyond the scope of one Power 5 mentor.
Leach was someone who viewed college football and life through a different prism, often delightful, sometimes puzzling, but never boring.
My favorte Leach story is told by former  Alabama quarterback Greg McElroy, who was a blue chip recruit coming out of the Dallas Fort Worth area of Texas.
McElroy was headed to Alabama, but was intrigued enough by Leach's offensive system at Texas Tech to take a visit to Lubbock.
When he arrived on campus, ready to talk  football with Leach, he was startled when Leach started talking about the essentials of life and posed a question about how many rooms were necessary in a house.
McElroy quickly returned home and committed to Alabama and Saban, where he won a national championship.
It prompted me to think about the current group of Top 25 CFB coaches and how they could fit into three categories:
1. Characters, whose personalities often overshadow what they do on the field.
2. NIL/Transfer Portal, flirting with the rules type of coaches who adjust to the current trends
3. Old School Coaches who rely on analytics and process and grudgingly move forward, who still succeed most of the time.
1. Georgia-Kirby Smart---Old school
Believes in the system, which is still based on recruiting.
 Michigan -Jim Harbaugh--Old School
Was a character for quirkiness for a few years, but has gone more old school and now has back to back Big Ten titles and Final Four appearances.
3. TCU-Sonny Dykes.  Character.
 Comes from a strong football pedigree, the son of former SWC, Big 12 coach Spike Dykes
4. Ohio State-Ryan Day--Old School
Paid his dues as an assistant and is now running a Top 5 traditional program with the Buckeyes
5. Alabama-NIck Saban--Old School
The poster boy for old fashioned, ""the process''' way of building a top tier college football program. G.O.A.T status
6. Tennessee-Josh Heupel--NIL, Transfer Portal
Rebuild using new tools and do it every year if necessary.
7. Clemson-Dabo Swinney--Old School
An Alabama product in Saban mold.
8. Utah-Kyle Whittingham
Old School
Most solid coach West of Mississippi, not a lot of fanfare, but gets the job done year after year.
9. Kansas State-Chris Kleiman---Old School
Paid his dues at FCS and lower levels, uses transfer portal, but still believes in building programs on a long term basis.
10-Lincoln Riley--NIL/Transfer Portal
Poster child for new breed of college football coaches and rebuilding EVERY year with new faces.
11. Penn State-James Franklin--Old School
We say old school with an asterisk since Franklin is not adverse to doing whatever works and will build a team using any system.
12. Washington-Kalan DeBoar-NIL/Transfer Portal
Made turnaround with Michael Penix Jr. at QB coming in from Indiana
13. Florida State-Mike Norvel-Old School
Was on endangered species list until this year's turnaround. FSU might be back among the blue bloods, but that may depend on transfer portal.
14  Oregon  State-Jonathon Smith--Old School
Done a solid job with the Beavers, turning them into a Top 20 caliber team.
15--Tulane--Willie Fritz--Old School
Rebuilt, but used transfers to make it happen. Surprised he is still at Tulane.
16. Oregon-Dan Lanning--NIL, Transfer
   Too soon to call since this was his first year coaching, but his success this season was based on Auburn transfer Bo Nix at QB.
17.  LSU-Brian Kell--NIL, Transfer Portal]
Would have said old school at ND, but at LSU everything is on the table and the idea is that is has to be done quickly.
18. UCLA--Chip Kelly--Character
   Was a systems guy early in his career, now he is more of a character with anything possible and a quirky personality.\
19.  South Carolina-Shane Beamer--Character
Son of  legendary coach Frank Beamer, Shane is making a mark at South Carolina with his own style, which uses transfer portal and some old time family wisdom.
20. Texas-Steve Sarkasian--Old School
Bounced around and has done more as a coordinator than a head coach. Endangered species.
21  Notre Dame-Marcus Freeman--Old School
Young guy with lots of new ideas, but he is coaching at ND and restricted in many ways.
22  Mississippi State-Mike Leach, RIP, Former DC and now  new head coach Zach Arnett.
Leach was a legend. Too soon to tell what Arnett will be.
23. NC State-Dave Doeren--Old School
Has done a solid job at NC State, building a Top 20 program.
24. Troy-Jon Sumrail--NIL, Transfer Portal.
Just a guess here, since Sumrail is finishing his first year with a team which posted a solid 11-2 record.   Need another year of data.
25. UTSA-Jeff Traylor-NIL, Transfer portal, Old School
Done a solid job in two years and will be moving on, sooner rather than later, but looks like a star in the making.",TMG Sports,Mark-blaudschun,Mark blaudschun,"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 19:56:46 GMT","The death of Mississippi State football coach Mike Leach has diminished the sport far beyond the scope of one Power 5 mentor.

https://www.si.com/college/tmg/mark-blaudschun/sanders-ready-for-prime-time,A Jersey Guy: CFB is ready for Prime Time,"The announcement had nothing to do with rankings, bowl match ups, or conference configurations.
Although it mighty eventually affect all of those areas.
No, it was a simple and somewhat expected announcement about a coaching carousel change at Colorado, a school anchored at the bottom of the Pac-12 conference with a 1-11 record.
But this announcement was different from the start
Prime Time was coming to Boulder.
That would be Coach Prime.
Deion Sanders, more famous as the guy with Alabama Coach NIck Saban in commercials than he was for his coaching credentials at Jackson State, which are fairly impressive.
Or as former football and baseball player at Florida State and in the NFL and in MLB or as a few years of success as a coach at the  FCS level not gaining much respect..
How audacious.
I think it was a brilliant pick by Colorado which was hovering in that dreaded ""irrelevance''' level which is the bottom floor in any sport.
Colorado may be many things in the next several months and years, but it is no longer irrelevant.
People are paying attention, as they should. 
No doubt many of them were surprised and aghast when Sanders arrival in Boulder came with a message for the current Colorado roster--check out the transfer portal.
How could he do that?
Well, he could and he has and he will.
He was asked about his concerns about the Colorado job.
""Do I look like a man that worries about anything,'' he said at his opening press conference. """"Did you see the way I walked in here? Did you see the swagger that was with me? Worry? Baby, I am too blessed to be stressed I have never been one for peer pressure. I put pressure on peers. I never wanted to worry. I make people worry. I don't get down like that. I am too dam confident. That is my natural odor. I don't even wear cologne. That is confidence I am wearing.''
In a CFB world where coaches are recycled among FBS schools, where there is much swagger, often without subsequent substance, Sanders may indeed fail in the Pac-12 and at this level.
There will be an immediate test next September when Colorado opens its 2023 season at TCU, which is one of the four teams in the CFP semifinals.
Sanders will coach Jackson State in its game against North Carolina Central in the Celebration Bowl in Atlanta--and then he will be on a private jet back to Boulder for what could be a much bigger and extended celebration.
Coach Prime is on stage.

https://www.si.com/college/tmg/mark-blaudschun/bowl-system-evolving,A Jersey Guy: Last hurrah for current bowl system?,"It was 1983. 
I was in my second year covering college football for the Dallas Morning News and it was bowl season, with making match ups being an intriguing part of a sport filled with behind close door and handshake arrangements.
There were 16 post season bowl games and it was truly a reward for a season well done.
I was so involved, I actually made a match up in the Sun Bowl between SMU and Alabama.
How did that happen?
With so few bowl games, as the national college football writer for the DMN, I knew most of the bowl directors and athletic directors and coaches involved.
The Sun Bowl, played in El Paso, Texas was led by executive director Tom Starr.
Starr had achieved a minor triumph when he secured No. 6 SMU for one of the spots, but he was having problems finding a marquee opponent when I did my daily check of how his match up was progressing.
 I told Starr I had an idea and would get back to him.  I then called Ray Perkins finishing his first season coaching at his alma mater. 
I knew Perkins well from his days as head coach of the N.Y. football Giants, working as a reporter in New Jersey covering the Giants.
The Tide had not quite rolled that season, compiling an 8-4 record which knocked Alabama out of New Year's Day bowl line up, but still made it an attractive opponent
But Bama had not committed to any bowl game yet, so I made a call and asked Perkins where he was taking his team.
""""Not sure yet, '' said Perkins, """"We're trying to find the right team to play (Alabama always has had clout). 
""""How about SMU, I suggested. """"SMU?,'' said Perkins. """"What bowl?
""Sun Bowl,'' I said. 
""""That works,'; said Perkins.
I told him I would call him back.
I then called up Tom Starr in El Paso and said, """"Alabama'?
There was silence and then a ""Really'' and I told Starr to make the call to Perkins,
An hour later the deal was done and Alabama went on posted a 28-7 win over the No. 6 ranked Mustangs.
Those days are long gone, as the bowl system has evolved and grown and grown, morphing into a system in which more than half of the 131 teams play in bowl games, with a 12 team playoff format two years away.
Such changes have consequences and the bowl system, more like a playground for giving participation rather than achievement awards has been diluted beyond belief.
There are now 42 bowl games which far exceeds the quality of play
The transfer portal and the early defections to the NFL now are draining post season roster of talent at an alarming rate.
Check all of the bowl match ups, including the once sacrosanct New Year's Day bowl games and see how many potential NFL players actually play in the bowl games, opting to ""prepare for the NFL.''.
With the expanded playoff teams (from 4 teams to 12, the bowl system will take another jolt.
Take for example, the four bowl match ups you will see next weekend in the Bahamas Bowl  (Miami (Ohio) vs. UAB; Cure Bowl (UTSA vs. Troy), Fenway Bowl (Cincinnati vs. Louisville) and  Lending Tree Bowl (Rice vs. Southern Miss)
As opposed to an opening round playoff line up of:
Tulane at Kansas State
Washington at Ohio State
Penn State at Alabama
USC at Tennessee.
Which games would you prefer?
The bowl system has begun a change which will be seismic.
The key player here is ESPN,,which owns several of the bowls games it televises
.I foresee a future in which the bowl system is basically a two-week span of games, all played at the Disney World complex in Orlando, Fla in a mini stadium (20,000) as part of a Disney World Sports/Vacation package, which includes hotels, Disney World admission and tickets to bowl games played between Dec 16-31 in one spot.
In some ways it would be a fitting epitaph--a reward for a season, well done, good weather, lots to do including Disney World visits, one and perhaps two bowl games a day over a two-week period.

https://www.si.com/college/tmg/herb-gould/cfp-lineup-set,The Gould Standard: Playing Favorites. Georgia and Michigan Will Try to Buck Upset Trend.,"Back in the day, a Georgia-Michigan final would have been a no-brainer. This year, they face the added weight of being heavy favorites.
 If ever there was a year where the simple solution is also the best solution, this college football season is it.
 Georgia vs. Michigan.
 Two unbeaten champions from the two most notoriously best conferences. No other unbeaten teams to question the system.
 And college football, which seems to delight in making the simple complicated, may get there yet.
 Although Ohio State and TCU may have something to say about that.
 In a way, I hope they do. Because it’s kind of fun to, you know, watch games that come with surprises.
Las Vegas bookmakers, who favor the Dawgs and the Wolverines by at least a touchdown, have made their point about the best bets.
 Face it. Georgia has been the team all season by a wide margin. If anti-trust law applied to college football rosters, the Justice Department would be camped out in Athens.
 And yet. . . what is the Dawgs’ best win outside the state of Georgia? They did not beat an SEC team that won more conference games than it lost when they crossed their state line.
 Once again, when Georgia takes on Ohio State in Atlanta—a neutral site!—it will be playing its ninth game in the Peachy State.
 So the Dawgs have got that going for them.
 Meanwhile, Michigan, which was written off due to its lame nonconference schedule, faces TCU, which is still being written off for its narrow escapes and dubious schedule.
 So. . . the Wolverines-Horned Frogs matchup is a game between disrespected (in their minds) teams—although Michigan has gone from disrespected to the team that has dethroned Ohio State as the perennial power in the Big Ten.
If you're a fan of disrespect. . . Advantage, TCU.
And by the way, Ohio State now gets to play the disrespect card, too.
 Do not underestimate the importance of that.
 If there is one thing we learned from the final stages of this regular season, it is that being favored to win doesn’t always translate into winning.
 Just ask Ohio State, TCU, USC and Clemson. And LSU. And. . . 
In other words, the supposed best teams in the Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, ACC and SEC West all suffered surprising late-season stumbles.
 That’s why I like college football. You never know what you're going to see.
 And that’s why I don’t put too much stock in committees deciding which teams are best. I much prefer to let players and coaches decide that.",TMG Sports,Herb-gould,Herb gould,"Tue, 06 Dec 2022 16:28:59 GMT","Back in the day, a Georgia-Michigan final would have been a no-brainer.

.That issue will be settled within the next month. 
What will linger for a while is the overall evaluation of the 2022 college football season.
Biggest winners
TCU is obvious. Almost no one expected the Horned Frogs make much of a jump beyond their 5-7 record of a year ago, even with new coach Sonny Dykes taking over after coming from SMU.
Well, 12-1 and a play away from a 13-0 season and a Big 12 championship is pretty good.
Tulane is another turnaround story. The Green Wave was 2-10 a year ago, but coach Willie Fritz put together a magic season which prod an 11-2 record, an American Athletic Conference title and a spot in the Cotton Bowl against USC .
USC WAS the story until Utah ended the Trojans  CFP hopes with a thumping in the Pac-12 title. 
But new USC coach Lincoln Riley built a Top 10 program in one year through the transfer portal and the Trojans are now back in the national spotlight.
UCONN and New Mexico State.
The two programs have new coaches and started the season ranked 128 and 131 produced 6 win seasons and are playing in bowl games.
Biggest Losers
Texas A&M is the runaway winner. Coach Jimbo Fisher had the Aggies ready for prime time with a great recruiting class, lots of NIL money and a Top 10 pre-season ranking.
Whoops. 
Last place in the SEC West, a loss at home to Appalachian State and a  5-7 record are not stats you want to promote. 
Miami
New Coach Mario Cristobal had the magic formula for the now long suffering Canes who have not been a national force since the start of the century. The NIL rulings offered ways the Canes could make pay for play work.
Well, Miami played, but the Canes didn't play and their Pre-season Top 20 ranking faded to a 5-7 bowl less season including an embarrassing home loss to Middle Tennessee State.
Clemson.
Yes, the Tigers were 11-2 and won the ACC and are going to the Orange Bowl, but Coach Dabo Swinney, who stubbornly refused to switch from inconsistent QB D.J. Uiagaleiei until the ACC title game against North Carolina, cost his team a chance for a playoff spot by his stubbornness when the Tigers were upset by South Carolina in their regular season finale.
A more decisive switch earlier in the year to highly touted  freshman Cade Klubnik might have prevented that. It was Klubnik who took over in the ACC title game 
to give the Tigers a win and a spot in the Orange Bowl.
D.J is in the transfer portal and Swinney will have to live with what might have been this season since a win over South Carolina would have put Clemson in the CFP playoffs instead of Ohio State.
***
Extra points
Prediction, Colorado and new coach Deion Sanders will be the biggest story in the off season, and through the first part of next season as they attempt to do what USC did in the Pac-12 this year--become relevant with a new coach....Boston College, which tumbled to 3-9 this season has hit a new level beyond hapless: irrelevance . Just a guess but watch out for the Patriots bringing back former assistant Bill O'Brien (now the OC at Alabama) as their next OC.

The national semifinals will be on Dec. 31 in Atlanta and Glendale, Ariz. The National Championship will be at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif. on Jan. 9.
The two games have plenty of story lines to keep us going until New Year’s Eve.
For example: Did you know that for all of their great tradition, Georgia and Ohio State have met only once?
It came on Jan. 1, 1993 in the Citrus Bowl in Orlando. Georgia running back Garrison Hearst was the MVP of the game, a 21-14 win by the Bulldogs. The quarterback was Eric Zeier, who left Georgia in 1994 as the SEC’s all-time leading passer.  It was the Bulldogs’ best team under Ray Goff.
Kirk Herbstreit of ESPN was the Buckeyes’ quarterback. He told me Sunday that his biggest memory of the game was Georgia linebacker Mitch Davis.. 
On Dec. 31, 2022, some 30 years later, the Buckeyes and the Bulldogs will play again with considerably more on the line. No. 1 Georgia (13-0) the defending national champions, will meet No. 4 Ohio State (11-1) in the semifinals of the College Football Playoff. The game will be at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, just over an hour away from the Georgia campus in Athens.
Georgia certainly expected to be in the semifinals as the No. 1 seed after beating LSU 50-30 in the SEC championship game on Saturday.
Ohio State, on the other hand, had to sweat it out until ESPN’s Rece Davis called the Buckeyes’ name at just past noon on Sunday.
Ohio State was thought to be out of the CFP after the Buckeyes got thumped by Michigan, 45-23, in Columbus, Ohio, moving the Buckeyes from No. 2 to No. 5 in the next-to-last rankings. To have a chance Ohio State needed for something ranked ahead of them to stumble. 
“Our season was on life support,” said Ohio State Coach Ryan Day. “We needed for something good to happen.”
Something good did happen Friday night when No. 4 USC was thrashed by Utah 47-34 in the Pac-12 championship game. That opened the door and Ohio State moved up one notch and into the playoffs.
Michigan (13-0) was a lock to be the No. 2 seed in the playoffs after the Wolverines’ handled Purdue 43-22 in the Big Ten championship game. It was Michigan’s second straight conference title.
With Georgia, Ohio State, and Michigan in the field, there was drama surrounding the final pick.
No. 3 TCU lost to Kansas State 31-28 in overtime in the Big 12 championship. Thus began a debate on whether or not the Horned Frogs should stay in the top four at 12-1.
First-year coach Sonny Dykes admitted that he had a sleepless Saturday night while he and his team waited on the decision from the selection committee. The committee kept TCU at No. 3 based on that fact that the Horned Frogs’ (12-1) only loss was a rematch with Kansas State, which they beaten 38-28 earlier in the season.
The other moment of drama came from a late push by No. 6 Alabama to get into the playoffs. Crimson Tide Coach Nick Saban, who has seven total national championships (6 at Alabama, 1 at LSU) took to the airwaves to make the case that the Crimson Tide (10-2) deserved a shot if the true goal of the committee was to pick the four BEST teams.
Saban pointed out that his team’s only two losses were on the last play of the game at Tennessee (52-49) and LSU (32-31), two of the toughest places to play in all of college football.
But at the end of the day, Alabama’s 10 wins wasn’t enough to supplant TCU and its 12 wins.
So the committee kept TCU at No. 3 and moved Ohio State from No. 5 to No. 4.
Here is an early breakdown of the national CFP semifinals:
CFP SEMIFINALS
Dec. 31, 2022
No. 2 Michigan (13-0) vs. No. 3 TCU (12-1), 4 p.m., Glendale. Ariz.
TV: ESPN
The line: Caesar’s Sports Book has Michigan as a 9 1/2 -point favorite.
The story: TCU made the four-team CFP field despite losing to Kansas State on Saturday (31-28) in the Big 12 championship game. The Horned Frogs don’t have the overall athleticism of Michigan, but this team has played with mental and physical toughness all season. Quarterback Max Duggan put on an incredible performance in the loss to Kansas State. Michigan is the better team but this one will be closer than the experts think.
No. 1 Georgia (13-0) vs. No. 4 Ohio State (11-1), 8 p.m., Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta.
TV: ESPN
The line: Georgia is favored by 7.
The story: Georgia, the defending national champions, will be playing its third game of the season in Mercedes-Benz Stadium. On Sept. 3 Georgia beat Oregon 49-3 in the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Classic. On Saturday Georgia beat LSU 50-30 in the SEC championship game. This is only the second time in history that Georgia and Ohio State have met in football. The other time was the 1993 Citrus Bowl. Ohio State looked to be out of the playoff after losing big at home on Nov. 26 to Michigan. After giving up 30 points to LSU, Georgia is still the nation’s No. 2 team in scoring defense (12.8 ppg).

Does Alabama Have A Shot?","ATLANTA--The 13-member panel that makes up the College Football Playoff Selection Committee had better make another pot of coffee. It could be a long Saturday night.
The final weekend of college football's regular season got off to an unexpected start Friday night when No. 4 USC was thumped by Utah 47-24 in the Pac-12 championship game.
So conventional wisdom had it that No. 5 Ohio State (11-1), which did not play on Saturday, would simply slide into the No. 4 spot and that would be that.
The expectation became that the top three in the CFP Standings—Georgia, Michigan, and TCU—would take care of business and everybody would get to go home early.
Georgia did its part in manhandling LSU 50-30 in the SEC championship game in Atlanta. The defending national champions are expected to be the No. 1 seed when the final CFP rankings are released at Noon on Sunday (ESPN).
No. 2 Michigan, coming off a huge win over Ohio State last week, kept its status as the No. 2 seed as it beat Purdue 43-22 late Saturday night in the Big Ten champioship game.
But when I woke up Saturday morning, something told me it was not going to be that easy.
It wasn't.
TCU, which began the day at 12-0, had been winning close games all season. But on Saturday the Horned Frogs ran out of luck, losing to Kansas State 31-28 in overtime in the Big 12 championship game.
There was a point of view that TCU should stay in the top four despite the loss.
But as Saturday afternoon turned into Saturday night there was the nagging feeling that that perhaps the committee's work would not be so simple.
A number of issues are on the table for the selection committee.
They could move TCU down to No. 4 and say they deserve to be there because they played more games than the next two contending teams, Alabama (10-2) and Tennessee (10-2). But if TCU goes to No. 4 the CFP would have a Michigan-Ohio State rematch of the game played Nov. 26.
You could put No. 6 Alabama in the field because the Crimson Tide's two losses to Tennessee and LSU were both on the road and both on the last play of the game. The Tide also has quarterback Bryce Young, the reigning Heisman Trophy winner. 
But the understandable pushback from Tennessee, which won head to head against Alabama, would be enormous.
TCU would have a case as the Horned Frogs not only won two more games, they beat every team on their schedule. Saturday's Big 12 championship game was a rematch of a 38-28 regular-season meeting.
Here's my take. There will be a lot of discussion of what to do with TCU. But at Noon on Sunday the playoff field will be: 
No. 1 Georgia
No. 2 Michigan
No. 3 TCU
No. 4 Ohio State
Georgia and Ohio State would play their national semifinal game on Dec. 31 right back here at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. It would mark the third time this season Georgia has played here, just about an hour away from its campus.
Michigan and TCU would play its semifinal on Dec. 31 in Glendale, Ariz.
The CFP national championship will be on Jan. 9 at SoFI Stadium in Los Angeles.
So who's going to be mad with these four teams?
Alabama and Tennessee fans won't understand why TCU is in and they are out. They will make the claim that TCU simply isn't as talented as these two SEC powers. The committee is supposed to select the four BEST teams, right?
And, as many texters told me on Saturday: ""There ain't no way TCU is one of the best four teams in college football.""
Maybe not. But the committee, as chairman Boo Corrigan said earlier, likes wins. TCU is one of only three teams in FBS football with 12 wins (Georgia and Michigan are the other two).
Before the game most analysts said that Georgia, Michigan, and TCU would be in the playoffs win or lose.
Georgia and Michigan won. TCU lost in overtime. So basically nothing has changed.
Alabama Coach Nick Saban, who has seven national championships, was on FOX at halftime of the Big Ten championship game Saturday night. He made his case that Alabama, whose losses to Tennessee  (52-49) and LSU (32-31) were on the road at two of the toughest places to play in college football. Alabama lost both on the last play of the game.
Saban knew that the selection committee would be up late watching.
""Let's get the best teams in,"" said Saban. ""Look at the teams being considered and if we played them would we be the favorite or the underdogs? That should anwser the question.""",TMG Sports,Tony-barnhart,Tony barnhart,"Sun, 04 Dec 2022 03:41:07 GMT",ATLANTA--The 13-member panel that makes up the College Football Playoff Selection Committee had better make another pot of coffee.
