The Alabama Crimson Tide will be making its 17th appearance in the Sugar Bowl, the most of any team, when it squares off against the No. 9 Kansas State Wildcats inside Caesars Superdome on Dec. 31 (11 a.m. CT on ESPN).
BamaCentral is counting down the Top 10 Sugar Bowls for Alabama:
#2 Alabama 14 (Final: 11-1-0, #1) #1 Penn State 7 (Final: 11-1-0, #4)
A 30-yard pass from quarterback Jeff Rutledge to split end Bruce Bolton with eight seconds remaining in the first half gave Alabama a 7-0 lead, and the two teams traded touchdowns in the third quarter with running back Major Ogilvie following a block by tight end Rick Neal. But Alabama’s defense was setting the tone for the game, as Penn State’s longest gain in the first half was a 10-yard run by fullback Matt Suhey, and a 32-yard reception by tailback Mike Guman was negated by an illegal-motion penalty.
However, in the final minutes Penn State recovered a misdirected pitchout at the Alabama 19 and soon found itself with third down at the 1-yard line.
“It was gut-check time,” linebacker Barry Krauss said. “We looked at each other. We knew this could be it. When they broke the huddle, everything got silent. Boy, talk about gut-checks.”
Defensive back Don McNeal made the first stop roughly a foot away from the end zone and when Nittany Lions quarterback Chuck Fusina walked to the line of scrimmage to see how far the ball was from the goal line, defensive tackle Marty Lyons supposedly warned him: “You’d better pass.”
 Instead, Paterno called Guman’s name for a run up the middle.
 Immediately after the snap, the pile started to form. Linemen David Hannah, who had an injured knee drained by doctors the day of the game and wasn’t supposed to play but went in for the stand, Byron Braggs and Lyons did their part, neutralizing the Penn State blockers, so when Guman hit the hole there was only him and Krauss, who met in a bone-jarring head-on collision. With the fullback stood straight up short of the end zone, defensive back Murray Legg and linebacker Rich Wingo quickly closed to push Guman backward and finish him off. 
The blow broke Krauss’ helmet and he fell to the ground. Due to a pinched nerve, he remained on the field unable to move his left side until Lyons reached down and grabbed him and the two made their way to the sideline.
Alabama held on for the 14-7 victory, and topped the final Associated Press poll, but Southern Cal leapfrogged the Tide to No. 1 in United Press voting, resulting in a split national title. Krauss, an All-American and the Sugar Bowl MVP, was selected in the first round of the NFL Draft. He played 10 years for the Baltimore Colts before finishing his career with the Miami Dolphins.
 But his No. 77 on the goal-line stand was the image of the 1978 season and graced the cover of numerous magazines, including Sports Illustrated.
“That goal-line stand was something I’ll never forget,” Bryant said.
Excerpt from ""100 Things Crimson Tide Fans Should Know and Do Before They Die.""
What remained was a fourth quarter for all the marbles, and the Nittany Lions’ one chance to claim it came when defensive end Joe Lally recovered an Alabama fumble on the Tide 19 with 7:57 to play.
On the next play, fullback Matt Suhey ran 11 yards to the Bama 8 for a first down. Then Guman took a pitch and gained two yards to the 6.
On second down, Fusina dropped back and quickly delivered a pass to Fitzkee, who was flaring out near the right sideline. Fitzkee caught the pass at the 1, but before he could turn to find the end zone he was slammed out of bounds by cornerback Don McNeal two feet short of a touchdown.
It’s a play that Fitzkee and Penn State fans have relived in their minds for years, but it always ends the same: coming up a little bit short.
“People still bring it up,” Fitzkee said decades later. “I’ve heard a lot of criticism, and I’m sure those guys who didn’t get in on third and fourth down have heard it too.”
That would be Suhey and Guman.
On third down, Suhey took the handoff up the middle, but he was wrapped up by linebacker Rich Wingo.
“Fusina came out to look at the ball,” Bama tackle Marty Lyons recalled, “and I was standing in the way, in between him and the ball. He started smiling. ‘How much is it?’ he asked. I told him, ‘’Bout this much.’ ‘Ten inches?’ ‘Yeah,’ I said. ‘You better pass’.”
On fourth down, the Nittany Lions tried to muscle it in again, but Guman ran into Krauss.
“They had called timeout before the fourth down, and they were trying to figure out what they were going to do and what we were going to do,” Krauss said. “We thought they’d go outside or throw because they had run it on third down (to no avail), so I had given myself a little more depth so I could flow to the outside. When he gave it back to Guman, and he came back inside, there was a hole. He saw it, and I did too.”
The collision was one that, as Krauss remembers it, made time stand still.
“He came over and I was able to hit him,” Krauss said. “After that, I wasn’t sure what happened.”
Krauss, who had all but resigned himself to the likelihood that Penn State was going to score, never thought the hit would knock Guman short of the goal line. “It seemed like he was so close,” Krauss said. “He was falling, and what was actually a couple of seconds seemed like five minutes.”
But Guman did come down short, and so did Penn State.
The Alabama defense left the field jumping, whooping and hollering, not noticing that Krauss remained prone on the field. Eventually the dazed line
Excerpted from the book “Sugar Bowl Classic: A History” by Marty Mulé.
One vivid image was permanently etched into the minds of the 76,824 in the Superdome and the millions of television viewers who watched the 45th annual Sugar Bowl on New Year’s Day, 1979. Penn State, the nation’s No. 1 team, was stopped on two consecutive plays inside the one-yard line by the Alabama defense to preserve a 14-7 victory for Alabama’s second-ranked Crimson Tide. The famous goal-line stand won a national championship for Paul “Bear” Bryant and the Crimson Tide.
The Rising of the Tide, by John Underwood
On the day before his Sugar Bowl showdown with Penn State, Bear Bryant breakfasted in the elegant refuge of his hotel suite high above New Orleans on a floppy-looking egg-and-bacon sandwich (brought up in a brown paper bag) and coffee in a Styrofoam cup. Between swallows the Bear was saying that if there was one thing you could be sure of about his Alabama defense it was that you couldn't be sure of his Alabama defense. It had been great at times and unsound at times, and that's ""not recommended"" when you play the No. 1 team in the nation, one that had not lost in 19 games.
Bear noted that the Tide defense had been hurt a lot. That it had been particularly slowed in the secondary by those injuries, and by, well, being slow in the secondary. And that it was about to go under the gun against a quarterback, Penn State's Chuck Fusina, whom Coach Joe Paterno called the best passer he ever had. The situation fairly cried out for a dedicated, if not wild-eyed, pass rush, and ""rushing the passer is the thing we do worst,"" said Bryant.
As for the Alabama fans who were establishing themselves as No. 1 in whoops and hollers downstairs in the hotel and up and down Bourbon Street, Bryant said he wished they'd be quiet until after the game.
Well, Bear, you can come down now and join the merry group. And bring the defense with you. On second thought, have them bring you.

It's expected to be the last time Alabama Crimson Tide fans will see quarterback Bryce Young and linebacker Will Anderson Jr. wear crimson and white uniforms, but they don't seem to be flocking to New Orleans for next week's Sugar Bowl. 
At least not yet. 
With plenty of seats available for Alabama vs. Kansas State, prices have been dropping in the secondhand ticket market. 
According to SI Tickets, $27 can now get you into the Caesars Superdome for the Dec. 31 game, and there's a wide variety of upper-deck seats available for under $40. 
Lower-terrace seating was going for as low as $86 as of Friday morning, with loge-level seats available for as low as $89.
Plaza-level seating in the lower bowl were selling for as low as $95, although most were going in the $130-200 range.
The most expensive asking price was $1,347 each for set of six-to-eight loge-level seats.
It's a top-10 matchup, but a number of factors may be keeping fans from making the trip, especially since Alabama is out of the national championship picture after being ranked fifth by the College Football Playoff selection committee. 
New Orleans on New Year's weekend is an expensive trip even without air fare, and kickoff is scheduled for 11 a.m. 
Moreover, the teams have no history together as it's the first time Alabama will ever face No. 9 Kansas State, the Big 12 champion. 
In 27 games against Big 12 opponents, the Crimson Tide holds a 10-14-2 record. 
Alabama head coach Nick Saban has never faced the Wildcats during his career and holds a 5-2 overall record against Big 12 opponents, including a 4-1 mark at UA. 
Kansas State head coach Chris Klieman has not faced Alabama during his head coaching career.
Both Young and Anderson are expected to declare for the 2023 NFL Draft as both could be top-five selections.

Alabama ran away with the nation's top class during this week's early signing period.
The Crimson Tide's 28 commits and seven five-stars beat out everyone else by a country mile. Georgia wound up in second, and Texas third — but both were a good bit behind on the trail.
Alabama was ranked in the 30s early on in the recruiting process, and it was worrisome to fans. But nevertheless, Nick Saban came back with a bang and secured the second-highest ranked class in the history of college football.
It wasn't projected to go down this way. The Crimson Tide flipped many recruits at the final second. Kadyn Proctor was on his way to Iowa — until he wasn't. Desmond Ricks was on his way to LSU — until he wasn't. Many thought Caleb Downs and Justice Haynes were shoo-ins at Georgia — until they weren't. Auburn thought it may have the edge on Tony Mitchell, James Smith and Qua Russaw — until it didn't.
Saban and Alabama hurt the feelings of many this year. And they may continue to do so in the coming years on the gridiron if this class is as talented as it's supposed to be.
The Crimson Tide already has five hard commits in the Class of 2024 — one five-star and four four-stars. It's good enough for the No. 5 spot currently. 
That's a good start.
Julian Sayin — the lone five-star at the moment — is a 6-foot-1, 185-pound quarterback from Carlsbad, Calif. He's currently the No. 2 signal-caller in next year's class. There will be a lot of names floating around the Alabama quarterback room when he comes in, so it will be interesting to see how that situation plays out. Jalen Milroe and Ty Simpson are already in Tuscaloosa. Eli Holstein and Dylan Lonergan are on the way. So the question is — who will earn the starting position in 2023? Once that is decided, the dominoes will begin to fall.
Next up is another highly-touted cornerback from Pinson, Ala. Ring a bell? Jaylen Mbakwe is the No. 5 cornerback in the Class of 2024 and the top player in the state of Alabama. He has one more year at Clay-Chalkville. If Kool-Aid McKinstry exits for the NFL after next season, his replacement may come from just down the road.
Want another similarity? A big, physical receiver from Foley is on his way to play for the Crimson Tide in 2024. Perry Thompson is the top wide receiver in the state, coming in at 6-foot-3, 202 pounds. He also runs track. Could he be the next Julio Jones? Only time will tell.
Two more guys to keep an eye on are Martavious Collins (ATH) and Sterling Dixon (EDGE) who have both committed to Alabama.
We still have around 365 days to figure out the Class of 2024, but it's always good to get a head start as the Crimson Tide looks to pick up another record-breaking recruiting class next year.

https://www.si.com/college/alabama/bamacentral/another-top-recruiting-class-nick-saban-answer-all-things-cw,"It Wasn't Just Another Top Recruiting Class by Nick Saban, But an Answer: All Things CW","The Alabama coach didn't have to wait for next season to make a statement about the future of the Crimson Tide, which remains more than bright.
The All Things CW notes column by Christopher Walsh will appear in five parts this week, one (nearly) each day. This is ...
Lather. Rinse. Repeat. 
If you haven't seen this before from Nick Saban, or the Alabama Crimson Tide during his tenure, you're either really young or haven't been paying close attention. 
Over and over it's been the same thing. Doubt Saban? Fine. Write off the Crimson Tide, ok. Claim, again, that the dynasty is over, and this time you really mean it. ... whatever. 
Every time Saban and Alabama have come back strong. 
He's like the college football version of the drinking bird toy, remember those? As soon as things start to dip down a little, he springs right back up and somehow looks even more upright than before. 
Try imagining one with a straw hat. 
The pattern, though, is there, and impossible to argue against. 
Recruiting rules were altered to curtail the coach. They didn't slow him down. 
The game was geared to favor offenses. Saban adjusted.
The transfer portal became a thing and many believed would level things out somewhat. He used it as well as anyone, filling key gaps in his lineup.  
Every time there's been a significant change, Saban has stuck with what's worked for him while essentially asking ""Ok, is this the way it's going to be?"" and then figures out the best way to use it to his advantage. 
That's why this recruiting class was so important for Alabama. The vultures and energy vampires were beginning to circle again because, gasp, the Crimson Tide only finished fifth in the CFP rankings. 
It was also the first early-signing day after the offseason dust up with Texas A&M coach Jimbo Fisher after Saban said the Aggies ""bought"" all their players last year. 
My how things have changed since Fisher called Saban's comments ""despicable."" The Aggies went 5-7 and missed out on playing in a bowl game, and have had scores of transfers. 
And then Fisher actually had this to say after not having one of the best recruiting classes this year: 
""I knew eventually there would be pay-for-play, but I did not know it would be NIL like it came about. The problem with all of it is that there is no consistency and rules. And then when you get into the (transfer portal), there is so much tampering going on. It is utterly ridiculous. It is a joke. It’s an absolute joke. We are only in college football.""
I don't even know where to begin on that. Neither did Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin, who comments on everything. He simply went with a tweet of a facepalm emoji.
We won't know for years, but Alabama's latest signing class has the potential to be as good, if not better, than any in history. 
Take a quick look at how this year's class looks on a depth chart and you'll get a feel for just how impressive haul this was for Saban, with Alabama named the 2023 national recruiting champion even before one the best cornerbacks, Desmond Ricks, committed and signed on Thursday. 
The players who were rated as being 5-star talents by any of the major services, or the among the top 32 players on the SI99, are bolded: 
On paper it's not just an epic class, but an all-star team. It's like an NFL team having nine first-round draft picks. 
Some of these players the Crimson Tide had rated higher than the services, as well, especially one of the quarterbacks. 
But also look at the measurements of the offensive linemen before they spend a single day in the Alabama weight room: 6-6 315, 6-7 295, 6-3 350, 6-6 358 and 6-7 330. Take a guess at which one is for the player SI's John Garcia Jr. had listed as the No. 9-overall player in the nation (it's the last one). 
With all that in mind, there were three telling things about Saban's press conference on Wednesday regarding this year's signing class. 
1) He didn't single anyone out. 
Had Saban commented on player he probably would have had to mention at least 15. 
2) The coach immediately talked about the character of the class. 
It's everything nowadays, especially during the NIL era. 
One thing that Saban's know for years is that there's nothing stopping someone who had his hand out as a recruit from doing so again. That's the kind of player who often becomes a distraction, and knows he has leverage over the coach. 
However, money is obviously a factor nowadays with NIL. Alabama has numerous advantages on top of whatever is being promised elsewhere. 
Among them is Alabama's NFL success. Players have a greater chance of seeing a lot more money on the other end if they play for the Crimson Tide. 
But Saban can pretty well say the same of the active players through NIL deals. 
For example, the latest On3 NIL Valuations have quarterback Bryce Young at the top at $3.5 million, with linebacker Will Anderson Jr. fifth at $1.7 million, and cornerback Kool-Aid McKinstry in the Top 25 at $796,000. 
The highest valuation of a player from Kansas State, Alabama's upcoming opponent in the Sugar Bowl, is running back Deuce Vaughn at $293,000. The quarterback, Adrian Martinez, as at $138.000. 
3) Saban still loves recruiting. 
He's that rare coach who's great at recruiting, at coaching and at being sort the CEO of the team (although he refers to it as being like a bus and he's driving). He's still outworking the competition, and that's not going to change.   
""I like it all,"" he said. ""I watch every player that we recruit. I make an evaluation. We come to an evaluation and an agreement as a staff. And then I love the relationship-building process. I love when guys visit here and you get to visit with them and develop relationships with them, see what's important to them in recruiting. And also the recruiting process when you go out on the road, meet their high school coaches and their families. And when their families come here and visit.
""There's nothing about the recruiting process that I don't really enjoy. I enjoy it all.""
So the next time you hear a critic or opposing fan talk about the demise of Saban or the Crimson Tide, here's all you need to tell them: Go read a shampoo bottle.

10-2.
If you told Alabama basketball fans that 10-2 would be the Crimson Tide's record at the conclusion of the nonconference portion of the season, most would have gladly accepted those numbers.
With Alabama's 84-64 win over Jackson State on Tuesday evening, the Crimson Tide earned its 10th win of the season. The last time that an Alabama team finished nonconference play with 10 wins? All the way back to the 2014-15 season. That Crimson Tide team finished with a 10-3 record at the same point in the season.
However, that team didn't have nearly as many quality opponents on its schedule.
When examining the 2014-15 Alabama schedule, the highlight victory for the Crimson Tide is a 56-53 win over college basketball blue-blood UCLA. However, the rest of the wins were not nearly as impressive: Towson, Western Carolina, Southern Miss, Arizona State, USF, Tennessee Tech, Stillman, Appalachian State and North Florida.
Its three losses? Iowa State, Xavier and Wichita State.
""I think it’s been [since the] 2014-15 season is the last time that we had 10 wins heading into SEC play and to do it with the schedule that we’ve put together,"" Alabama head coach Nate Oats said on Monday, prior to the team winning its 10th game. ""I think that speaks to the level we’ve gotten the program here. My guess would be the last time they had 10 wins going into SEC play the schedule looked significantly different than what it looked like for us this year.
""It was one of the tougher nonconference schedules in the country.""
Oats is absolutely right. According to KenPom, Alabama has the 15th-toughest strength of schedule in the country. Other metrics, such as the NET rankings, have the Crimson Tide listed even higher at fifth.
In Quad 1, Alabama is 2-2 — its only two losses of the season. In Quad 2, the Crimson Tide is 3-0. In Quads 3 and 4, Alabama is 2-0 and 3-0, respectively. And when you consider that the Crimson Tide's only two losses came at the hands of UConn — the No. 1 team in the country according to KenPom — and Gonzaga (who is No. 11 on KenPom), then those neutral-site losses don't look nearly as bad.
Let's examine Alabama's schedule to this point.
The Crimson Tide eased into the 2022-23 season with wins over Longwood, Liberty, South Alabama and Jacksonville State, with only the game against the Jaguars being played on the road. From there, Alabama traveled to Portland, Ore. to play in the Phil Knight Invitational. In the tournament, the Crimson Tide opened with a big win over a red-hot then-No. 12 Michigan State team before losing to then-No. 20 UConn. However, Alabama bounced back in a big way in its final game of the tournament, downing then-No. 1 North Carolina in a four-overtime win that put the Crimson Tide on the radar for college basketball fans.
A win over South Dakota State served as a bridge between two No. 1 teams, as Alabama then traveled to then-No. 1 Houston and handed the Cougars their first loss of the year. A win over Memphis to avenge last year's loss was then followed by a 100-90 loss at the hands of then-No. 15 Gonzaga in the C.M. Newton Classic in Birmingham, Ala.
Tuesday night's win over Jackson State marked the end of the nonconference portion, with just one road game at Oklahoma on Jan. 28 for the SEC/Big 12 Challenge remaining.
It hasn't been the easiest of schedules by far, but Oats believes that the toughness of the schedule accomplished its purpose.
“I would say we’ve gotten done a lot of what we needed to get done,"" Oats said. ""We’ve gotten quality wins. I mean, you look at Houston: they went on the road and won at Virginia. That’s going to stay one of the best wins in the country over the course of it. I mean, Houston may not lose the rest of the year. You look at Gonzaga: we lost to Gonzaga but Gonzaga may not lose the rest of the year. Some of these teams we’ve played — I mean, UConn’s really good. They’re in the Big East, so they’re gonna have some tough games but they’re gonna stay top-five in the country the rest of the year would be my guess.
“Some of these teams we’ve played are gonna remain top-five, top-10 teams. We’ve got wins over — North Carolina’s gonna start playing much better in my opinion, Michigan State’s gonna get healthy and be a contender in the Big Ten again — so these wins have put us in a spot to get a good NCAA tournament seed if we take care of business in the SEC. But they’ve put us in a great spot.""
According to ESPN's Joe Lunardi, Alabama is projected to be an automatic qualifier as the winner of the SEC Tournament, earning itself a spot as a 2-seed in the NCAA tournament. Considering the Crimson Tide's nonconference start, a 2-seed is an adequate projection. However, there is still an entire SEC portion of the season that Alabama has to trudge through.
Last season, the Crimson Tide was in a similar position that it is today. Alabama finished the nonconference portion of the season 9-3 with wins over Houston, Gonzaga and Miami. However, a disastrous loss to Memphis and a slip-up against Davidson in the C.M. Newton Classic began a series that saw the Crimson Tide lose five of eight games.
This year, Oats and Alabama are dead-set on not repeating the same mistakes as last season.
“I thought we were in a decent spot last year, we just didn’t continue to improve like we needed to,"" Oats said. ""We need to get better game-to-game, we’ve gotta get our defensive identity back. But if we could get back to who we were defensively playing well and take care of business in the SEC and get us a decent record, we’ve set ourselves up to have a pretty good NCAA tournament seed based on what we’ve done in nonconference so far.”
There are already signs that this team is not going to make the same mistakes. Complacency was an issue that ran rampant among last year's squad. Make no mistake: the 2022-23 Crimson Tide has its own mistakes that it needs to work on. However, complacency does not seem to be one of those concerns.
Over the course of the season thus far, turnovers have grown to become one of Alabama's biggest glaring issues. The Crimson Tide has averaged just under 17 turnovers per game, with the game-by-game numbers slowly but steadily increasing as the season has gone on.
In Alabama's loss to Gonzaga, the Crimson Tide turned the basketball over 21 times, resulting in 23 points for the Bulldogs. Even against Jackson State, Alabama turned the ball over 17 times. Fortunately, the Crimson Tide has been able to offset most of its turnover woes with solid play on the defensive end of the court, particularly in the rebounding department. However, turnovers will ultimately cost Alabama multiple games if it doesn't get the problem fixed before SEC play.
If you talk to the players, though, it seems that the Crimson Tide is very well aware of the issues at hand.
“I mean, we learned a lot of lessons,"" graduate student forward Noah Gurley regarding nonconference play. ""We learned lessons about playing on the road, we learned lessons about playing in overtime, we learned lessons about playing down, playing up. You know, conference play is crazy. Ain’t no telling what’s going to happen night-in, night-out.
""I feel like Coach Oats did a good job with our strength of schedule this nonconference in really preparing us so we know what it takes. We know if we guard on the defensive end, it’s going to be hard to keep up with us.”
From here, Alabama now takes a break for Christmas before returning to campus for a late 8 p.m. practice on Christmas Day. The four full days off will serve as not just a means for players to return home and see their families on the holiday, but also as a rest and recovery period following its grueling nonconference stretch.
On Dec. 28, the Crimson Tide will travel to Starkville, Miss. to open SEC play against Mississippi State. The Bulldogs started the season 11-0, but experienced its first loss this week against Drake. From there, Alabama will host Ole Miss before facing a tough three-game stretch against Kentucky, Arkansas and LSU, with the game against the Razorbacks being played on the road.
It's not the easiest of starts to conference play for Alabama. That being said, the team is ready to address its problems and return to action despite the Christmas break just getting started.
When asked what he planned on doing over the holiday break, junior forward Nick Pringle said that he'll be reviewing film from the nonconference schedule in order to prepare for SEC play.
“I would really just say just looking back at all the games that we played — the strength of schedule — and just learning and growing from that,"" Pringle said on Tuesday. ""We have a mature team. I think we’ll take the right approach from that and the rest is history. I mean, I feel like we have the team to beat. We’re really good as a team. I mean, just stacking days from here on out is all we’re really focused on.”
That doesn't sound like a player that shares the same mentality of last year's team.

Women's basketball: Alabama 89, North Florida 25
December 23, 1926: Alabama's All-Southern conference center Gordon ""Sherlock"" Holmes was striken with an appendicitis in El Paso, Tex., while the team was en route to Pasadena for the Rose Bowl showdown with Stanford. Sophomore Babe Pearce was tabbed to fill in for Holmes, who told doctors he was going to catch the next train to Pasadena to be with the Crimson Tide.
December 23, 1991: Trevor Releford was born in Kansas City, Mo.
“I'll never forget going to the Rose Bowl. I remember everything about it. We were on the train and Coach [Frank] Thomas was talking to three coaches and Red Heard, the athletic director at LSU. Coach Thomas said, ‘Red, this is my best football player. This is the best player on my team.' Well, shoot, I could have gone right out the top. He was getting me ready. And I was, too. I would have gone out there and killed myself for Alabama that day."" – Paul W. “Bear” Bryant","Sports Illustrated Alabama Crimson Tide News, Analysis and More","Crimson tide, All things bama, Crimson tide roll call",Katie windham,"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 06:00:00 GMT","Your daily briefing on what's going on with Alabama Athletics, and how to watch the Crimson Tide.",https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NjQwMDYyMzU5NTQ1MzY4/usatsi_7678835.jpg
https://www.si.com/college/alabama/player-development/alabama-adds-another-piece-to-top-signing-class-with-cb-desmond-ricks,Alabama Adds Another Piece to Top Signing Class with CB Desmond Ricks,"Ricks boosts the Crimson Tide's No. 1 signing class as another highly-rated prospect.
Nick Saban and the Alabama Crimson Tide already wrapped up the No. 1 spot in Sports Illustrated's 2023 recruiting rankings early Thursday morning, but in the afternoon, it added another highly-rated prospect to the group. 
Cornerback Desmond Ricks announced his commitment to Alabama Thursday evening, choosing the Crimson Tide over the likes of LSU and Florida.
During his announcement ceremony, Ricks said he made his choice Wednesday and called Saban to let him know. 
He becomes the 28th overall member and seventh 5-star prospect by some outlets in Alabama's 2023 joining the likes of safety Caleb Downs, edge rusher Keon Keely, offensive tackle Kadyn Proctor, Justice Haynes and Carver High School products James Smith and Qua Russaw, who committed Wednesday. 
As a safety, Downs is the top overall prospect in Alabama's class, but Ricks joins Jahlil Hurley as a cornerback in the 2023 class. 
Back in October, Ricks reclassified from the class of 2024 to be a part of the 2023 class. He took official visits to Alabama, Florida and LSU before ultimately deciding to sign with the Crimson Tide. 
Ricks is the latest in a long line of prospects out of IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida with current players on the roster like JC Latham, Tyler Booker and Ja'Corey Brooks and former players like Evan Neal, Bo Scarborough and Dylan Moses. He grew up in Virginia before playing his final two years of high school football for IMG in Florida. 
Despite the same last name and high school, Ricks has not relation to current Alabama defensive back Eli Ricks.

For the third time since Sunday, it was all Crimson Tide inside Coleman Coliseum. 
Alabama women's basketball closed out a four-game home stretch with an 89-25 win over North Florida Thursday afternoon.
""Really good effort from our team today,"" Alabama head coach Kristy Curry said after the game. ""I thought they did an amazing job of being where their feet were instead of focusing on heading home this afternoon. I thought they really took care of business.""
Freshman Karly Weathers led all scorers was one point off her season high with 21 points on 5 of 9 shooting from beyond the arc. She also grabbed seven rebounds. 
It was an overall impressive day for the Crimson Tide shooting 3-pointers. Brittany Davis opened the scoring with a 3-pointer, and it was just a sign of things to come.Alabama was 15-for-39 from deep, marking the third straight game the Crimson Tide has made at least 15 3-pointers. Aaliyah Nye had four and Davis added three of her own.  
The Crimson Tide was dominant from the opening tip on, but especially in the second half, only allowing ten points in the final 20 minutes of play. 
Alabama finishes non-conference play with an 11-2 record on a nine-game win streak and will head into a slight break for the holidays before opening SEC play at home against Georgia Dec. 29 at 6 p.m.
""You always want your team to go home with a smile at Christmas, so today I’m really excited that our team gets home with a smile at Christmas,"" Curry said. ""I loved the way the won the game today. It’s always about how you win, and I loved the way they approached the opportunity today.”

The Alabama Crimson Tide will be making its 17th appearance in the Sugar Bowl, the most of any team, when it squares off against the No. 9 Kansas State Wildcats inside Caesars Superdome on Dec. 31 (11 a.m. CT on ESPN).
BamaCentral is counting down the Top 10 Sugar Bowls for Alabama:
#2 Alabama 34 (Final: 13-0-0, #1) #1 Miami 13 (Final: 11-1-0, #3)
No. 1 Miami was riding a 28-game winning streak before the Sugar Bowl and wanted to make sure everyone knew it. Among the numerous boastful things the Hurricanes said before the game was linebacker Michael Barrow’s: “We seek, we destroy. We fear no one, but everyone fears us.”
But Alabama didn’t, and for the most part kept quiet during its preparations. Although the Crimson Tide was considered a heavy underdog, its mission became simple, make the Hurricanes eat their words.
Did they ever.
Led by the defense, Alabama began to take control in the second quarter. After shutting down the run, with the Hurricanes accumulating only 48 rushing yards, the Crimson Tide went to work on quarterback Gino Torretta, who had just won the Heisman Trophy.
“In the second quarter, I saw Torretta look over at me and he froze for a second,” defensive end John Copeland said. “I saw fear.”
At times, the Tide put all 11 defenders on the line of scrimmage and dared Torretta to try and beat the man coverage by defensive backs like Langham and safety George Teague, behind swarming ends Copeland and Eric Curry, and linebackers Lemanski Hall and Derrick Oden.
Meanwhile, the Crimson Tide offense never got around to establishing the passing game because it never really had to. Quarterback Jay Barker threw for just 18 yards, with the ground game pounding out 267 rushing yards for an impressive 34-13 victory.
Excerpt from ""100 Things Crimson Tide Fans Should Know and Do Before They Die.""
Alabama’s defense had been giving Torretta problems all day but the one play that virtually spelled the end for Miami came on their next possession. The Tide pulled all 11 players up to line with Torretta operating from the shotgun. His errant pass was snared by George Teague who high-stepped 31 yards for the second Tide touchdown in 16 seconds.
Teague was matched against Miami tailback Jonathan Harris, who was lined up in a slot to the right. Teague jammed Harris as he tried to come off the line of scrimmage. Torretta, who was pressured all night by the Alabama defense, chose to force a throw towards Harris. But Teague stepped in front of Harris, caught the pass at the 31, took off toward the right sideline and high-stepped the last five yards into the end zone for a 21-point lead. This play by Teague would be a big one in the Tide’s victory, however, it would not be the only one he would be remembered for in this game. 
Trailing 27-6, the Hurricanes offense took the field to mount a successful drive. On Miami’s second down and 10 play, Teague made one the biggest defensive plays of the season, although it was null and void because of a five-yard offside penalty called against Alabama. Torretta hit his favorite receiver, Lamar Thomas, who was streaking down the sideline for an apparent six points. Teague streaked down the sideline, ran Thomas down, stripped the ball from him, and proceeded to advance the ball in the other direction for a short gain. The play may not be officially recorded in the record books but it will stand as one of the best defensive plays ever
The Hurricanes never knew what hit them.
“The whole second half is a blur,” quarterback Gino Torretta, who entered the game with a 26-1 record as a starter, said afterward.
The plan was simple. Alabama suspected it could run on Miami, while believing the ‘Canes could not against the Tide. The key was foiling the Miami passing game.
The handwriting was on the wall in the opening 30 minutes, a span in which the Tide outrushed the Hurricanes 152-6. Bama, an eight-and-a-half point underdog, took a 13-6 lead before turning the lights out on Miami.
Then the Tide hit the Hurricanes with a roundhouse blow by scoring two more touchdowns in the span of 16 seconds
Excerpted from the book “Sugar Bowl Classic: A History” by Marty Mulé.
“The End of the Run” by Austin Murphy
Maybe the old man can finally get some rest. Three coaches and one decade to the month after the death of Bear Bryant, Alabama won its 12th national title and its first in 13 years. After biting their lips for a week while the Miami Hurricanes woofed and howled their contempt for the Crimson Tide, the Alabama players dominated and, perhaps more satisfying, muzzled the defending national champions with a 34-13 win in the Sugar Bowl on New Year's. Now that they can once again lay claim to college football's throne, perhaps Tide fans, who have been known to pray for Bryant's resurrection, will let the Bear lie in peace.
Pay no attention to Alabama coach Gene Stallings's stubborn refusal in the days leading up to the game to concede that his team was an underdog. This was an upset of magnificent proportions. Crimson Tide quarterback Jay Barker could not be counted on to pass his team to victory, and, in fact, he would complete only four of 13 throws for 18 yards and suffer two interceptions. Likewise, the outside running game would be an exercise in futility. As long as Jessie Armstead, Micheal Barrow and Darrin Smith have started at linebacker, no team has been able to turn the corner on Miami.
Alabama would have to run between the tackles—football's truck route—behind a smallish, undistinguished line that, until recently, 'Bama fans had maligned. At 6'3"" and 250 pounds, center Tobie Sheils is slight for a major-college lineman. Left guard George Wilson shot off half of his left foot in a 1989 hunting accident. And six nights before the game, right tackle Roosevelt Patterson was verbally assaulted in the French Quarter. ""You must be an offensive lineman, you fat, sloppy ——,"" Miami linebacker Rohan Marley had shouted at the amply padded, 290-pound Patterson.
Chalk one up for the shrimp, the gimp and the blimp. Behind them, Derrick Lassic rushed for 135 yards on 28 carries, the most yards a back gained against the Hurricanes this season. ""They said we were one-dimensional,"" said Sheils after the game. ""We are one-dimensional. Sometimes you only need one dimension.""

https://www.si.com/college/alabama/player-development/sports-illustrated-names-alabama-2023-national-recruiting-champion,Sports Illustrated Names Alabama 2023 National Recruiting Champion,"The final call in the race for the nation's top class is made, as the rest of the country is once again looking up to Nick Saban and the Crimson Tide.
There's still almost two full days remaining in the early signing period, plus National Signing Day in February still to go, but Sports Illustrated had seen enough. 
Thursday morning, it named the Alabama Crimson Tide the national recruiting champion for the Class of 2023.
No other program was still within striking distance after Nick Saban announced the signing of 27 players —25 high school additions plus two junior-college transfers — on Wednesday evening. 
The list included 12 players in the SI99 rankings, two more than any other program and three of the top nine players:
3. DE Keon Keeley—Tampa (Fla.) Berkeley Prep6. S Caleb Downs—Hoschton (Ga.) Mill Creek9. OT Kadyn Proctor—Des Moines (Iowa) Southeast Polk
""Got a good bunch of players, but I think what I like about this group the most is it seems like they have really good character,"" Saban said during his final press conference before the team travels to New Orleans on Monday to play Kansas State in the Sugar Bowl. 
""We still sort of try to get guys to buy into developing, creating value for their future based on getting an education, being a good person, being the best football player they can be. So I feel like the kinda guys that we were able to attract are the right kind of guys and we're excited about the class.""
What put Alabama over the top in clinching the title was the late commitment of Proctor on Tuesday, followed by the signings of the top two prospects in the state, who were teammates at Carver High School in Montgomery. 
Elite front seven recruits James Smith and Qua Russaw were always considered a package deal, and successfully kept quiet about where they were going until the very end. Auburn made a late push for each under its new staff and Florida was also involved down the stretch. 
""It was important because we come from the same background,"" Smith said on the ESPN broadcast of their announcement. ""We just do everything together so we're gonna come in together.""
