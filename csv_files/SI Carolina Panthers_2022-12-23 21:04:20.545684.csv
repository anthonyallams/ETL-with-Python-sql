https://www.si.com/nfl/panthers/gm-report/behind-enemy-lines-with-john-maakaron-of-all-lions-22,Behind Enemy Lines with John Maakaron of All Lions,"We receive some insight on this week's opponent, the Detroit Lions.
Ahead of tomorrow's Christmas Eve matchup with the Detroit Lions, I reached out to All Lions publisher John Maakaron to get some inside on arguably the hottest team in the league. 
1. Why has Jared Goff been so successful this season?
Goff has worked closely with offensive coordinator Ben Johnson to highlight his strengths. They spent extensive time in the offseason watching film of what he did well with the Rams. The Lions have built a solid offensive line and given him solid offensive weapons, as second-year wideout Amon-Ra St. Brown has emerged as a reliable and consistent target. What plagued Goff earlier in the season was turnovers, but over the past 8 games, Goff has been protecting the football well and has been playing the best football of his career. He has the longest streak in the NFL currently without tossing an interception. 
2. Biggest reasons the Lions went from losing one-score games to finding ways to win them? 
The Lions started the season with a disappointing 1-6 record. Many bristled when head coach Dan Campbell told the media he truly felt his team was close to winning games and would be on the other side of close games if they stayed the course. Now, the Lions are clearly winning the turnover battle every week and they have been able to make the critical plays late. As I mentioned earlier, Goff is playing at an elite level and the defense is taking advantage of young players stepping up like Aidan Hutchinson and James Houston. The secondary was playing so poorly to start the year and the tough decision was made to fire defensive backs coach Aubrey Pleasant. Since then, the secondary has steadily improved.
3. One under-the-radar Lions player
Left tackle Taylor Decker came out this week and expressed his disappointment he was only named a 5th alternate for the Pro Bowl. Arguably, the veteran offensive lineman has played the best football of his career. He has not allowed many quarterback pressures or sacks and is part of one of the best offensive line units in the entire NFL. If Goff is given time and the protection holds up, Detroit's offense is among the most prolific scoring units in the NFL. Detroit's offense is scoring at a high clip, despite the running game not firing on all cylinders the past few weeks. If Detroit executes running the football this week, they will be impossible to beat this week. 
4. Score prediction 
This looks to be another close game for the Lions. I have been impressed with what Steve Wilks has been able to accomplish given the circumstances. Typically, the team with the better quarterback will end up winning these close games. I think Jared Goff and this Lions team are hungry and playing playoff-caliber football. Sam Darnold struggled in the passing game last week and the Lions will be looking to bring the pressure this week. If Detroit can force a couple of turnovers, they can leave Carolina with their seventh victory in their last eight games. It will be imperative for Detroit's offensive line to neutralize Brian Burns and keep Goff upright and with enough time to find his offensive weapons. I see the Lions winning this one, 27-24.

Earlier this week, the Carolina Panthers claimed cornerback Justin Layne off waivers from the Chicago Bears. The move was made due to the injuries of C.J. Henderson (ankle) and Jaycee Horn (shoulder), giving them some insurance in case either one of them was unable to go for Saturday's game against the Detroit Lions.
The good news? Both Henderson and Horn practiced all week and are expected to be full-go for this weekend's game. The bad news? Well, Justin Layne did not report to the Panthers' facility after being claimed and has been placed on the reserve/did not report list. Layne was not going to have much of a role on defense this week anyways but could have seen some time on special teams, where he has mainly played over the past two seasons. 
The Panthers now have 51 players on the active roster.

https://www.si.com/nfl/panthers/gm-report/spread-predictions-for-panthers-vs-lions-2022,Spread & Over/Under Predictions for Panthers vs Lions,"Can the Panthers cover the spread?
Each week, we at All Panthers will release an article on our thoughts on the spread and the over/under of Carolina Panther games. The star ratings next to the play describe the overall confidence in that particular play.
Star ratings:
1 Star - Not very confident
2 Star - A little confident
3 Star - Fairly confident
4 Star - Very confident
5 Star - Should be a lock to happen
Spread: Lions -2.5
1 Star play on the Panthers covering: I really don't know what to do with the side or total in this game if I'm being completely honest. I'm predicting it to be a one-point game, but it could go either way. With it being a short number and I'm expecting it to be a close game, I'll just side with the home dog here and take the points.
Over/Under: 43.5
1 Star play on the under: My original final score prediction has this just staying under the total, but it's hard for me to side with the under in a Lions game. Detroit's offense can score with the best of them, averaging 26.4 points per game, yet their defense is allowing 26 points a game. I'm not worried about the freezing cold temps. With no participation in the forecast, the weather shouldn't be an issue. Small lean to the over.
My picks last season:
ATS: 6-7 (46%)
Over/Unders: 8-5 (62%)
Total: 14-12 (54%)

https://www.si.com/nfl/panthers/news/panthers-de-brian-burns-named-nfc-pro-bowl-starter-2023,Panthers DE Brian Burns Named NFC Pro Bowl Starter,"Burns is headed back to the Pro Bowl.
Wednesday night the Pro Bowl rosters were announced and for the second straight year, Carolina Panthers defensive end Brian Burns has been named a starter for the annual event.
Burns is having yet another career year, already posting single-season highs in tackles (58), tackles for loss (14), and sacks (10.5). Earlier this season, the Panthers rejected a trade proposal from the Los Angeles Rams for Burns. The Panthers will always ""listen"" on players, but have made it clear that Brian Burns is a guy they want to build this young defense around.
""There's always more on the table, but Brian would be one of those priorities moving forward,"" GM Scott Fittere said last offseason when asked about possibly extending Burns. ""He's a guy that's come out and produced for us. I really like the leader he is becoming and the man that he is. He will be one of those guys that we definitely try to work on.""
In addition to Burns being named a starter, the Panthers have a handful of guys who could end up being on the Pro Bowl roster when it's all said and done. Special teams ace Sam Franklin Jr. and veteran punter Johnny Hekker have been named second alternates; CB Jaycee Horn a third alternate; C Bradley Bozeman and S Jeremy Chinn a fourth alternate and LB Shaq Thompson a fifth alternate.

https://www.si.com/nfl/panthers/news/carolina-panthers-claim-cb-justin-layne-off-waivers,Panthers Add to the Cornerback Room,"Carolina creates depth in the secondary.
The Carolina Panthers have claimed cornerback Justin Layne off waivers from the Chicago Bears.
Layne appeared in just 15 snaps in two games with the Bears this season but played in seven games for the New York Giants to begin the year. Throughout his four-year career, Layne has played the majority of his snaps on special teams, playing in just 29 defensive snaps over the past two seasons. 
With Jaycee Horn (shoulder) and C.J. Henderson (ankle) a bit banged up, the Panthers needed to add to the cornerback room, especially after the day Keith Taylor Jr. had this past week against the Pittsburgh Steelers.
""We have confidence in all of our corners,"" interim defensive coordinator Al Holcomb said during his Wednesday press conference. ""And Keith [Taylor] has played well. Obviously, he didn't have the best game last week. He's a competitor and I truly believe he's ready to bounce back and feels like he has something to prove.""
In 52 career games, Layne has totaled 45 tackles and one pass breakup. He was a third-round pick by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 2019 NFL Draft.

Run game struggles last week
""Yeah, obviously not our best day rushing the football. First things first, you got to give credit to the Steelers. They came out ready to play. Each game is its own deal. It's its own case study. They came out and won a lot of the one-on-one matchups. It was tough sledding in the run game. With that being said though, we showed some character. We kept fighting throughout the course of the game and we were in a position there to make a run at the end.""
Passing game
""I do know that Sam [Darnold] took a step last week. That was good to see. He looked like he was playing with some pretty good confidence out there and our pass game took a step which was nice to see some plays down the field.""
Pittsburgh loading up the box
""I think all year we really see a bunch of people in the box. That's something that's not new to us. Every team we play is going to find a way to get an extra hat in the box verse the way we play. I need to do a better job finding angles for us.""
Detroit's defense
""They're a young, hard-charging group. They play hard, they run downhill. They like to hit the gaps. They kind of reflect their head coach and their coaching staff. They play with a lot of energy and enthusiasm. They try to play one-on-one football, so we'll be challenged whether it's upfront or on the perimeter. Third down they like to play a lot of man-to-man, so it'll be a good test for us.""
Detroit's season turning around
""Really, I think you take the first half of the season and throw it out the window. I think they were just searching for ways to win games and recently they found that. They're playing good team football and I think they kind of settled down a little bit. They're a young team that's coming into their own and finding ways to win games

""If C.J. is healthy, yes.""
Concerns with Detroit's run game

They have a wide variety of different types of run concepts to try to get your eyes going in different places and different things of that nature. And then they have three really capable backs. These guys can run the ball. They can break tackles. And they can also catch the ball out of the backfield, so they're potent in terms of what they can do in the run game.""
The 21-play drive by Pittsburgh
""We got to find a way to get off the field on third down. We've got to execute better. We had multiple opportunities where guys have made those plays earlier in the game and we didn't execute at a high enough level.""
How Jeremy Chinn has played since returning from injury
""He had a lot of production last week against the Steelers in terms of tackles and things of that nature. But at the end of the day, he'd be the first to tell you that he's got to play better in critical situations. One of the things that we constantly talk about with Jeremy is having his eyes in the right position. If his eyes are in the right position, you're going to see him come up and make some big-time plays for us.""

Tuesday afternoon, the Carolina Panthers designated veteran wide receiver Andre Roberts to return from injured reserve. 
Roberts, who signed a one-year deal with Carolina in the offseason, was expected to make a huge impact on special teams as a kick and punt returner. Unfortunately, he hasn't been able to contribute due to a knee injury that he suffered in the first game of the season against the Cleveland Browns.
The Panthers have rotated several guys at both return spots all season long and have had a mixed bag of results. Laviska Shenault and Chuba Hubbard split the kick return duties for a while before Raheem Blackshear took over. Blackshear has done a terrific job elevating the production on special teams, averaging 27.5 yards per kick return. On punt return, Shi Smith is averaging roughly 7.2 yards per return.
Over the last 10+ years, there haven't been many returners better than Andre Roberts. He averages 26 yards per kick return and 8.7 yards per punt return with three touchdowns in each phase. Interim head coach Steve Wilks said that if he is able to play this week, they will consider using Roberts on both return units.
In addition to opening up Roberts' window to return, the Panthers also released Tae Hayes from the practice squad.
