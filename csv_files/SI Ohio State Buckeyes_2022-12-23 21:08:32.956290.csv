Dippre To Choose Between Alabama, Ohio State","Dippre, who caught a touchdown pass in the Terrapins' loss to the Buckeyes last month, will announce his decision on Tuesday.
Former Maryland tight end C.J. Dippre announced on Friday he will choose between Alabama and Ohio State when he makes his transfer decision on Dec. 27.
A sophomore from Scranton, Pa., Dippre caught 33 passes for 339 yards and three touchdowns in 25 games across two seasons with the Terrapins. That includes four receptions for 30 yards and a touchdown in the 43-30 loss to the Buckeyes last month.
Dippre notably hurdled cornerback Denzel Burke on a 25-yard reception on Maryland’s first offensive play of the game, while his one-yard catch gave the Terrapins a 13-10 lead heading into halftime. He then entered his name into the portal less than two weeks later.
Ohio State could lose its top two tight ends after this season, as sixth-year senior Mitch Rossi will be out of eligibility while redshirt junior Cade Stover – who led the Buckeyes will 35 catches 399 yards and five touchdowns – will have a decision to make on his NFL future.
The Buckeyes will have five other scholarship tight ends on the roster in junior Gee Scott, redshirt sophomore Joe Royer, redshirt freshman b, freshman Bennett Christian and incoming four-star signee Jelani Thurman, but that group lacks any starting experience.

If he chooses Ohio State, Dippre – who took an official visit with the Buckeyes last weekend – would become the third player to join the program through the transfer portal this month, joining Arizona State long snapper John Ferlmann and Kent State kicker Casey Magyar.

Recruitment Recap: Ohio State extended a scholarship offer to Jayden Bonsu in December and welcomed him to campus for the first time in March, as he attended a spring practice and hung out with junior linebacker Cody Simon, who hails from his high school.
He then returned to Columbus for his official visit in mid-June, which gave him a chance to spend some one-on-one time with head coach Ryan Day, defensive coordinator Jim Knowles, secondary/cornerbacks coach Tim Walton and safeties coach Perry Eliano.
Bonsu, who also took official visits that month to Miami (Fla.) and Michigan State, subsequently set a commitment date for Aug. 20. He then moved it up to July 20, which appeared to be good news for the Hurricanes due to their name, image and likeness efforts.
The Buckeyes ramped up their pursuit of Bonsu once Georgia five-star safety Caleb Downs committed to Alabama, though, and convinced him to hold off on a decision. Bonsu almost immediately began trending toward Ohio State and he picked the Buckeyes just a few weeks later. 
Things got interesting late in the cycle, though, as Bonsu did not sign his letter of intent with Ohio State until Thursday morning due to another NIL-related push from Miami. The Buckeyes had to sweat it out for an extra 24 or so hours, but he ultimately turned the Hurricanes down again and signed on the dotted line.
Evaluation: ""Bonsu’s frame and overall game are very similar to that of redshirt junior safety Ronnie Hickman, who is a fellow New Jersey native, and he could play any of the three safety spots in defensive coordinator Jim Knowles’ scheme, whether its the adjuster (free), bandit (boundary) or nickel positions.
""Some believe he could develop into a linebacker at the next level if he continues to add weight and muscle, though, which also brings to mind redshirt sophomore Kourt Williams and freshman Sonny Styles, who are both safeties but have the characteristics of a linebacker.""

https://www.si.com/college/ohiostate/football/ohio-state-football-recruiting-early-signing-period-takeaways,Ohio State Football Recruiting Early Signing Period Takeaways,"The Buckeyes signed several of the nation's top-rated prospects but also had some misses along the way.
Ohio State secured signatures from 19 high school prospects on Wednesday, seven of which rank among the top-100 recruits nationally, headlined by Florida five-star wide receiver Brandon Inniss.
“For me, on a day like today, these 19 guys that have signed right now, they deserve the recognition,” head coach Ryan Day said during his press conference this afternoon. “It’s a great group, and when you look at the quality of the people that we’re bringing in, that’s the focus right now.”
Ten different states are represented, including seven players from Ohio, four from Florida, two from Georgia and one apiece from Connecticut, Indiana, Maryland, North Carolina, South Dakota and Texas.
“These are guys that want to be Buckeyes, and they know the opportunity here,” Day said. “A lot of these guys did it for the right reasons, focusing on the things that truly matter. 
“It’s the development at Ohio State, it’s the ability to come in and get an unbelievable education, it’s being a part of a program that’s going to be in the national championship hunt every year, but also be a part of the culture and the city of Columbus. 
“There’s just so many things that come with being a Buckeye that these guys recognized early on, and it’s about relationships, and I think our coaching staff did an unbelievable job of building relationships throughout this process.”
More News From Sports Illustrated: College Football Bowl Schedule | It's Time To Get Rid Of College Football's December Signing Period | How A 12-Team Playoff Would Have Looked Every Year Of CFP | The Ultimate Dabo Swinney Quote
With that said, we’ve compiled a list of our biggest takeaways from the Early Signing Period below. 
Ohio State went 0-for-3 on Wednesday when it comes to five-star defensive ends, as Keon Keeley signed with Alabama, Damon Wilson signed with Georgia and Matayo Uiagalelei signed with Oregon. 
It was a disappointing finish for the Buckeyes, who trended with each player at various points in their respective recruitments but ultimately struck out late in the process due to NIL-related reasons.
“We felt like we were in pretty good position with a couple guys that didn’t work out in the end,” Day said. “We’ll keep recruiting. We’ll keep seeing what’s out there, but we’re always going to swing at the best players at the country.”
It wasn’t all bad news, though, as defensive line coach Larry Johnson was able to secure a signature from Indiana four-star Joshua Mickens, who figures to play the same hybrid role as sophomore Jack Sawyer.
“To add Josh to the class was great,” Day said. “He’s a guy that’s very athletic, a basketball player. For him to make the decision down the stretch was big for us. We think he can be a very, very good player.
“We also like Jason Moore’s ability to go inside and outside. He’s shown that. He was the player of the year in the area, had a big-time season, so he was important to get … I’m glad that we have the guys we have in this class.”
As mentioned, the Buckeyes signed seven in-state prospects on Wednesday, including offensive linemen Luke Montgomery, Joshua Padilla and Austin Siereveld, defensive tackle Will Smith Jr., linebacker Arvell Reese, cornerback Jermaine Mathews and safety Malik Hartford.
It’s the highest number of Ohioans in a class since 2020, when Ohio State signed eight players from within the state’s borders. There was a concerted effort to keep them home, too, as local players are often the foundation of championship-level teams.
“It’s more important than ever to make sure we have guys from Ohio and that we’re evaluating the guys in Ohio at a high level because between the transfer portal, the combination with NIL, there’s so many things that come with it,” Day said. “All these guys are going to have an impact. We can feel it. 
“Up until the last 48 hours, guys were calling them and recruiting them and talking to them about all kinds of different things, and they stayed loyal. That’s probably not going to go away because of the transfer portal, so the loyalty and understanding what it means to be a Buckeye is very, very important, and now more than ever.” 
Even though Ohio State signed four offensive linemen on Wednesday in Montgomery, Padilla, Siereveld and Connecticut three-star tackle Miles Walker, offensive line coach Justin Frye has extended offers to several tackles in the portal over the last week.
That includes Rhode Island’s Ajani Cornelius, Tulsa’s Dillon Wade, UTEP’s Jeremiah Byers and Washington State’s Jarrett Kingston, as the Buckeyes would like to add some starting-caliber players at a position that is likely to lose All-Americans Dawand Jones and Paris Johnson after the season.
“We’re not just going to add guys just to add guys, but if it’s right for them and it’s right for us, we’re certainly going to look down that road,” Day said. “I do think there’s a need to have some impact players in the (offensive) line. We’re going to lose some guys there.”
Cornelius and Byers came off the board on Wednesday, signing with Oregon and Florida State, respectively, while Wade is down to Auburn and USC. How things progress with Kingston remains to be seen, but expect Ohio State to continue to be active in the portal in an effort to address that need.
The same goes for a few other positions, namely defensive line given the aforementioned misses, as well as defensive back, which we’ll discuss momentarily. But otherwise, the Buckeyes did a good job of checking off the boxes at other positions this cycle.
“I think we’ve addressed a good portion of our needs,” Day said, noting there’s still more than a month until the traditional Signing Day and another portal window to add pieces. “I don’t think we’re all the way there yet, but this is going to be a long process all the way through until we play next year.”
Georgia four-star cornerback Kayin Lee flipped his pledge to Auburn on Wednesday, making him the fifth player to back off his commitment to Ohio State this cycle.
The others were Tennessee four-star quarterback Brock Glenn (Florida State), Florida four-star running back Mark Fletcher (Miami), Tennessee four-star tight end Ty Lockwood (Alabama) and Florida four-star cornerback Dijon Johnson (Florida).
That’s not an unusually high number, as the Buckeyes averaged just under four decommitments per cycle over the last five classes. The biggest difference is why several of them changed their minds, as they were motivated by name, image and likeness opportunities elsewhere.
“I just think it’s kind of the way of the world right now,” Day said. “Some guys decommit two or three times before they sign nowadays. I would say if it were 10 years ago, I’d probably say, ‘What’s going on?’ 
“I remember a time when somebody committed that everybody just stopped recruiting them. That doesn’t change anything anymore. With all the different things out there right now, guys are changing their minds and we just have to adapt to it. That just means when they commit, we just keep recruiting them.”
That said, it still the fifth time in six cycles that a defensive back has flipped during the Early Signing Period, joining Jaiden Woodbey (Florida State) in 2018, Jordan Battle (Alabama) in 2019, Clark Phillips III (Utah) in 2020 and Terrance Brooks (Texas) in 2022. Quite an interesting trend. 
Along those same lines, the Buckeyes are still awaiting word from New Jersey four-star safety Jayden Bonsu, who took part in a ceremony at his high school on Tuesday while wearing an Ohio State hat but didn’t send in his paperwork on Wednesday as Miami continues to push for a flip.
It’s a surprising turn of events, as Bonsu presumably turned down similar name, image and likeness offers or opportunities from the Hurricanes when he committed to the Buckeyes in August, only for them to pop back up just as he was set to put pen to paper.
It would be a tough pill to swallow for Ohio State if he does flip, as the staff has long wanted to take three safeties in the class – and even potentially a fourth with Bonsu, Hartford, Florida four-star Cedrick Hawkins if they could have flipped five-star Caleb Downs from Alabama.
“Being a three-safety defense, we needed numbers there,” Day said. “We didn’t have multiple years recruiting to a three-safety system, so it was important that we did that and will continue to do that.”
With Downs – and every other safety they’ve offered this cycle – now off the board after signing on Wednesday, Bonsu’s importance is only amplified. If he does flip, the Buckeyes will likely have to look to the transfer portal for help on the back end next fall, as well as potentially loading up on safeties in 2024.
Then again, Bonsu could just as easily stick with his commitment to Ohio State, rendering this entire point moot. And now we wait…

https://www.si.com/college/ohiostate/football/ohio-state-football-former-rhode-island-offensive-tackle-ajani-cornelius-commits-to-oregon,Former Rhode Island OT Ajani Cornelius Commits To Oregon Over Ohio State,"The Buckeyes were hoping to address a position of need with Dawand Jones and Paris Johnson almost certainly off to the NFL.
Former Rhode Island offensive tackle Ajani Cornelius announced on Wednesday evening he has committed to Oregon over finalists Nebraska, Ohio State and Tennessee.
The 6-foot-5 and 310-pound Cornelius has started 22 games at right tackle for the Rams over the last two seasons, earning first-team All-Colonial Athletic Association honors this fall after allowing just one sack.
Cornelius was one of four offensive linemen in the transfer portal to pick up an offer from the Buckeyes over the last week, joining Tulsa’s Dillon Wade, UTEP’s Jeremiah Byers and Washington State’s Jarrett Kingston.
While Byers has since committed to Florida State and Wade has narrowed his options to Auburn and USC, Cornelius took official visits with the Cornhuskers, Ducks, Volunteers and Buckeyes before setting a commitment date.
Ohio State has significant need at offensive tackle heading into next season, as All-Americans Dawand Jones and Paris Johnson are almost certain to declare for the NFL Draft after the season. That’s where the Cornelius came into play.

Cornelius notably led White Plains (N.Y.) Archbishop Stepinac to a pair of state championships in high school but was under-recruited and ultimately chose Rhode Island over offers from Bryant, Howard, Hampton and Morgan State.
He picked up 25 Football Bowl Subdivision offers since entering his name into the portal earlier this month, and with his choice of some of the nation's top programs, decided he wanted to continue his career all the way across the country at Oregon.
Kingston, meanwhile, likely becomes Ohio State's top transfer target moving forward. The All-Pac-12 honorable mention selection, who did not allow a single sack in nine starts at left tackle this season, has also announced an offer from USC so far.

Former Kent State kicker Casey Magyar announced on Wednesday afternoon he is transferring to Ohio State, where he’ll have three seasons of eligibility remaining as a preferred walk-on.
The 5-foot-11 and 165-pound Magyar spent one season with the Golden Flashes, making 1-of-2 extra point attempts during his true freshman season before entering his name into the transfer portal in July.
Magyar was a second-team all-state selection during his senior season at Dublin (Ohio) Coffman in 2020, as he connected on 3-of-4 field goal attempts, 38-of-38 extra point attempts and sent 55 kickoffs for touchbacks.

With sixth-year senior Noah Ruggles out of eligibility, Magyar could potentially compete with USC transfer Parker Lewis, redshirt sophomore Jake Seibert and freshman Jayden Fielding for the starting role next fall.
He becomes the second player to join the program through the transfer portal in the last five days, as the Buckeyes secured a commitment from former Arizona State long snapper John Ferlmann on Saturday.

https://www.si.com/college/ohiostate/football/ohio-state-football-linebacker-teradja-mitchell-transferring-to-florida-report,Report: Ohio State LB Teradja Mitchell Transferring To Florida,"Mitchell entered the transfer portal earlier this month but will remain with the Buckeyes through their playoff run.
According to a report from the Orlando Sentinel’s Edgar Thompson, Ohio State fifth-year senior linebacker Teradja Mitchell intends to transfer to Florida once the Buckeyes are finished with their College Football Playoff run.
A former five-star prospect from Virginia Beach Bishop Sullivan Catholic, Mitchell recorded 63 tackles, seven tackles for loss and one pass break up in 43 games across five seasons in Columbus, including one where he was named a team captain.
This was set to be Mitchell’s final collegiate season, as he took advantage of the extra year of eligibility granted to all student-athletes amid the pandemic to return this fall, but an undisclosed injury ultimately limited him to just four games.
With that, Mitchell was able to redshirt this season and can now play one additional year elsewhere, which is why he entered his name into the portal on Dec. 5, the first day of the 45-day transfer window.
More News From Sports Illustrated: College Football Bowl Schedule | Forde-Yard Dash: The Ultimate Bowl Games Breakdown | How Does A College Coaching Search Really Work? | Inside Zach Arnett's Abrupt Ascension At Mississippi State
The NCAA subsequently granted a one-time blanket waiver that will not count postseason participation at the FBS level toward a player’s redshirt status, so he could appear in the Peach Bowl against Georgia on Dec. 31 while retaining his eligibility.
Mitchell is one of three Buckeyes to enter the portal this month, joining redshirt freshman safeties Jaylen Johnson and Jantzen Dunn, who has since committed to Kentucky. He has not made an official announcement himself, however.

Ohio State four-star cornerback commit Kayin Lee announced on Wednesday morning he has signed with Auburn, marking the second year in a row that the Buckeyes have had a cornerback flip his pledge during the Early Signing Period.
The 5-foot-11 and 185-pound Lee, who is considered the 25th-best cornerback and No. 209 prospect overall in the class of 2023, committed to the Buckeyes in late June thanks to efforts by secondary/cornerbacks coach Tim Walton and defensive quality control coach Miguel Patrick.
The Tigers made a late push in Lee’s recruitment due to various name, image and likeness opportunities on the Plains and got him on campus for an official visit earlier this month. Meanwhile, Patrick – his former head coach at Ellenwood (Ga.) Cedar Grove, left Ohio State to be the new defensive line coach at UAB.

Both factors ultimately contributed to Lee flipping his pledge, and he now becomes the second cornerback to back off his commitment this cycle, joining Florida four-star signee Dijon Johnson. He's also the second cornerback in as many cycles to flip during the Early Signing Period, joining Texas freshman Terrance Brooks.
The Buckeyes still signed a pair of cornerbacks on Wednesday in Cincinnati Winton Woods four-star Jermaine Mathews and Waxahachie, Texas, four-star Calvin Simpson-Hunt. Expect the staff to address Lee's departure through the transfer portal, with former Virginia cornerback Fentrell Cypress at the top of the list of options.

https://www.si.com/college/ohiostate/football/ohio-state-football-recruiting-2023-impact-joshua-mickens-commitment-buckeyes,How Joshua Mickens' Commitment Impacts Ohio State’s 2023 Recruiting Class,"An in-depth look at what Mickens will bring to the Buckeyes both on and off the field.
Ohio State secured a signature from one of the nation’s top-rated edge rushers on Wednesday when Indianapolis Lawrence Central four-star Joshua Mickens pledged his services to the Buckeyes on the first day of the Early Signing Period.
The 6-foot-5 and 225-pound Mickens, who was also considering Florida State and North Carolina when he picked the Tigers back in July, finished his senior season with 74 tackles, 20.5 tackles for loss, 6.5 sacks, three forced fumbles, two quarterback hurries and one pass break up.
Mickens has all of the physical tools needed to play defensive end but also the athleticism to drop back in coverage. The Buckeyes envision him in the same role as sophomore Jack Sawyer, who played a hybrid role this fall under first-year defensive coordinator Jim Knowles.
That athleticism is especially apparent on the hardwood, where Mickens averaged 13.0 points and 7.3 rebounds for the Bears as a junior. He also put up impressive numbers in the discus and shot put – with a personal record of 53 feet in the latter – last spring, which speaks to his overall strength.
Mickens is the son of late Indianapolis Colts running back Arnold Mickens, who set 18 NCAA Division I-AA records during his career at Butler. That includes rushing for 2,255 yards in 1994, which trailed only Oklahoma State’s Barry Sanders (2,628 yards in 1988) and USC’s Marcus Allen (2,427 in 1981) for the most yards in a season at any level.

As for how the younger Mickens fits into Ohio State’s recruiting class, he’s the fourth defensive lineman to commit to assistant coach Larry Johnson this cycle, joining four-star tackles Kayden McDonald and Will Smith Jr., as well as four-star Jason Moore, who has the size and versatility to play on the interior and on the outside.
The Buckeyes were hoping to finish the cycle with one or two more players at the position from a group that includes Venice, Fla., five-star Damon Wilson, Tampa (Fla.) Berkeley Prep five-star Keon Keeley and Bellflower (Calif.) St. John Bosco five-star Matayo Uiagalelei.
Unfortunately, all three signed elsewhere on Wednesday, with Wilson likely heading to Georgia after a back-and-forth battle with Ohio State, Keeley sending his letter of intent to Alabama after committing earlier this month and Uiagalelei remained closer to home and picked Oregon.

Ohio State landed a commitment on Wednesday afternoon – the first day of the Early Signing Period – from Indianapolis Lawrence Central four-star defensive end Joshua Mickens, who backed off his pledge to LSU in late November after taking a pair of visits to Columbus.
The 6-foot-5 and 225-pound Mickens, who is considered the 20th-best edge defender and No. 131 prospect overall in the class of 2023, only picked up an offer from the Buckeyes during an unofficial visit for the win over Indiana on Nov. 12.
Things progressed quickly from there, as Mickens scheduled an official visit for the loss to Michigan just two weeks later. He had been committed to the Tigers since the summer, but many expected him to flip his pledge once he returned to campus for The Game.
Mickens is the fourth player to sign with Ohio State this cycle, joining Hyattsville (Md.) DeMatha Catholic four-star lineman Jason Moore, Suwanee (Ga.) North Gwinnett four-star tackle Kayden McDonald and Dublin (Ohio) Coffman four-star tackle Will Smith Jr.

The Buckeyes were hoping to add one or two more defensive ends to the class, but it's a disappointing day in that respect, as five-stars Damon Wilson (Georgia), Keon Keeley (Alabama) and Matayo Uiagalelei (Oregon) are set to sign elsewhere on Wednesday.

Recruitment Recap: Carnell Tate’s recruitment was widely viewed as a battle between Notre Dame and Ohio State, as the Chicago native took more than a dozen unofficial visits to Columbus and South Bend during the early parts of his recruiting process.
He even appeared close to making his college decision in October 2021, but held off as Tennessee made a late push thanks to name, image and likeness opportunities in Knoxville and his relationship with five-star quarterback commit Nico Iamaleava.
Wide receivers coach Brian Hartline’s track record for developing elite wide receivers helped the Buckeyes win out for Tate, who announced his decision in June in the first of a three-day string of commitments that included five-star Brandon Inniss and four-star Noah Rogers.
Tate took a late unofficial visit to USF, which recently hired former Volunteers offensive coordinator Alex Golesh as its new head coach, but it had little to no impact on his commitment, as he signed with Ohio State on Wednesday morning.
Evaluation: “This is a kid who can play everywhere, checks all the boxes and brings some size to the table. He’s a matchup nightmare for people. He gets that initial separation and he’s a very clean pass-catcher. He’s got a very unique athleticism for his size. It’s fun to watch.
""What makes him a big-time prospect is he has a high ceiling, but the difference between him and some other players is he has an incredibly high floor. I think that’s what makes Carnell unique. He has a real natural feel for the game, understands football, has a high football IQ and as he’s gotten stronger and bigger, he’s just become more dominant.”
