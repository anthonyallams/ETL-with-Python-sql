Here's how to watch, with all your TV information, top players, coaching bios and more.
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. — Indiana wraps up the nonconference portion of its 2022-23 basketball season on Friday night, taking on a small but scrappy Kennesaw State team that's won eight games already this season.
This is the last of 11 nonconference games for the Hoosiers, who will then have nearly two weeks off before resuming the Big Ten schedule on Jan. 5 at Iowa. Tonight's game is televised on the Big Ten Network.
Indiana guard Xavier Johnson is out for sure after having foot surgery on Wednesday. IU officials are hoping he'll be back sometime during the Big Ten season. Senior forward Trayce Jackson-Davis and junior forward Jordan Geronimo both missed Tuesday's game with Elon, and are day-to-day decisions.
We will update their status later tonight.

Here's the opening point spread and how both teams have done vs. the spread this season with some must-see numbers.
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. — Winter has roared into Bloomington like a lion on Friday, and it will be interesting to see what that does to attendance tonight when Indiana takes on Kennesaw State at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall. 
It might also have an impact on the noise level in the final nonconference game of the year.  Indiana is a 19.5-point favorite over Kennesaw State, and the over/under is 141.5, and at first glance, that number seems kind of low.
But don't be deceived. Dig deep, and there are good reasons why this is the only number under 24.5 for Indiana's seven ''cupcake'' games. Kennesaw is 5-1 vs. the spread in true road games.
As we discussed Thursday in breaking down Indiana's nonconference schedule, Kennesaw is the highest-ranked team outside of the Big Four — Kansas, Arizona, North Carolina and Xavier — on Indiana's schedule this year. They are No. 213 in the Kenpom.com rankings out of 363 teams. The other six were all 283 or worse.
There are also injury concerns with Indiana. Senior point guard Xavier Johnson is out for a while after having foot surgery, and star Trayce Jackson-Davis didn't play Tuesday for precautionary reasons. He had a back injury earlier in the season. that forced him to miss a game as well. Junior guard Jordan Geronimo missed Tuesday's game too, out with a finger injury. 
Kennesaw has been competitive in losses at Florida and VCU, and has road wins at Mercer and Charleston Southern. But a more apt comparison to what the Owls might expect in Bloomington is their Dec. 11 loss at San Diego State. 
The Aztecs, who were ranked in five of the first seven Associated Press top-25 polls, beat them by 32 points.  
That's a tempting lean toward the Hoosiers, but a quiet Assembly Hall and a depleted Indiana roster makes that a bit of a tentative step. (Editor's note: We will update this story later as we get closer to the game.) 
And let's also remember that there are no guarantees in college basketball. Just ask the Iowa Hawkeyes, who lost at home to Eastern Illinois on Wednesday as a 31.5-point favorite, the worst loss by spread in the modern era dating back more than 30 years of gambling numbers. 
Here's what Indiana has done so far this season vs. the numbers:
Here's what Indiana has done this season, straight up and against the spread::
Kennesaw State is 8-4 and the Owls are 3-3 in true road games. They are 6-3 vs. the spread all season, and a very impressive 5-1 vs. the spread in those road games.  Three of those home wins are cupcake wins over non-Division I teams.

Kobe Brown set career highs with 31 points and eight assists and D’Moi Hodge added 20 points to lead Missouri to a 93-71 upset of No. 16 Illinois in their annual Braggin’ Rights game Thursday night in St. Louis. 
Illinois dropped to 8-4 after the blowout, and lost for the second time in three games since upsetting then-No. 2 Texas on Dec. 6 at Madison Square Garden in New York. Terrence Shannon Jr. scored 21 points for Illinois and Matthew Mayer added 16.
Missouri, now 11-1 on the year, blew the game open in the first half with 15-0 and 10-0 runs. Their only loss came to Kansas, who's currently ranked No. 4 in the country and has wins over Big Ten teams Wisconsin and Indiana.
Outside of Mayer, who hit four threes, Illinois' starters were a combined 0-for-13 from three-point range and the team was 7-for-31 from deep for the game.
""That was horrible,"" Illinois head coach Brad Underwood said. ""As a coach, getting these guys prepared, I've got to do a better job. They out-toughed us, they out-fought us, they took our ball, they out-executed us.
""You can't take 31 threes and win. That's a pretty tough pill to swallow. I love to shoot threes, but they've got to be out of a rhythm and we're making one pass and shooting and not trying to run anything (or) execute anything."" 
Illinois' defense was brutal all night, giving up a season-high 93 points. No one else had scored more than 74 points in regulation.
""We messed up a lot of switches, especially the flairs,"" Shannon said. ""We've just got to be locked in on defense. We did a good job in practice but we've just got to execute during the game. We've just got to be better.""","Sports Illustrated Indiana Hoosiers News, Analysis and More","Big ten, Big ten roundup, Penn state basketball, Illinois basketball, Basketball, Brad underwood, Missouri basketball, Jalen pickett",Tom brew,"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 12:30:40 GMT","Illinois has nothing to brag about after getting blown out 93-71 by Missouri in their annual showdown in St. Louis.

https://www.si.com/college/indiana/basketball/meet-the-opponent-indiana-nonconference-slate-ends-with-kennesaw-state-friday,Meet the Opponent: Indiana's Nonconference Slate Ends with Kennesaw State on Friday,"On Friday night, Indiana gets one last chance to fine-tune things before the Big Ten season re-starts, playing its final nonconference game against Kennesaw State at Assembly Hall. Kennesaw has been playing well, posting an 8-4 record so far.
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. — Indiana puts a bow on its nonconference schedule on Friday night, taking on Kennesaw State at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall in the last of its 11 warm-ups to the Big Ten season.
Indiana made a point of bulking up its early slate, and they've done that with games against Xavier, North Carolina, Arizona and Kansas, all teams in the top 27 in the country in Thursday's latest Kenpom.com rankings. The Hoosiers beat Xavier and North Carolina, and lost to Arizona and Kansas, both projected No. 1 seeds at the moment.
The other games have been easy wins for the Hoosiers, who have been favored by 24 points or more in wins against Morehead State, Bethune-Cookman, Miami of Ohio, Little Rock, Jackson State and Elon. 
All six of those teams rank in the bottom 20 percent of the rankings of 363 teams, and none of them put up much of a fight. Kennesaw State, which plays in the ASUN Conference — formerly the Atlantic Sun — is 8-4 this season and has the highest Kenpom ranking of the softer part or the schedule, checking in at 213. It's the first time in school history that they've had a winning record in the nonconference, and they've done that despite playing just two home games.
Here's where they all start currently in the Kenpom.com rankings:
Kennesaw's four losses are to Florida, Campbell, VCU and San Diego State. Three of their wins are against non-Division I teams, so it's hard to gauge how good they actually are.
The school, north of Atlanta, has 41,000 students and has played Indiana twice before. The Hoosiers won 90-66 on Dec. 22, 2013 and again on Dec. 22, 2015, winning 99-72.  he Hoosiers are the first top-25 squad the Owls have faced since a loss at No. 9 Creighton on Dec 4, 2020. This also marks the 10th meeting for Kennesaw against a team from the Big Ten conference, with the Owls still looking for their first win against the league.
They have a guard oriented attack, led by leading scorer Chris Youngblood, who puts up 14.2 points per game. He's a 6-foot-4 junior from Tuscaloosa, Ala., and he;'s a 45.3-percent shooter from three-point range. He's also making 88.5 percent of his free throws.
Terrell Burden is the point guard, and the 5-foot-10 speedster from Smyrna, Ga., is averaging 11.3 points and 3.8 assists per game. 
Indiana goes into the game shorthanded. Senior point guard Xavier Johnson had surgery on his foot on Wednesday and will be out several weeks at least. The optimistic look is a mid-February return. He was injured during the loss at Kansas on Dec. 17.
Senior forward Trayce Jackson-Davis also missed Tuesday's win for precautionary reasons. He was dealing with a sore back earlier in the season, and missed a game a month ago as well. Junior forward Jordan Geronimo also didn't play Tuesday because of a foot injury. Their status is unknown for Friday's game, which starts at 7 p.m. ET. The game will be televised on the Big Ten Network.
Kennesaw is coached by Amir Abdul-Rahim, who has some distant Indiana ties. He coached for a year at Georgia under former Hoosiers coach Tom Crean before getting hired at Kennesaw State four years ago. ","Sports Illustrated Indiana Hoosiers News, Analysis and More","Indiana basketball, Kennesaw state owls, Nonconference, Kennesaw basketball, Basketball",Tom brew,"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 22:04:47 GMT","On Friday night, Indiana gets one last chance to fine-tune things before the Big Ten season re-starts, playing its final nonconference game against Kennesaw State at Assembly Hall.

History was made in Iowa City on Wednesday, when Iowa lost to Eastern Illinois 92-83 at Carver-Hawkeye Arena despite being 31.5-point favorites. It's the first time in the modern era that such a heavy favorite has lost a game.
How crazy is it? Since the mid-1980s, there were 588 teams that have been favored by 30 points or more. All 588 won — until the Hawkeyes lost, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. 
There was good reason for Iowa to be such a heavy favorite, too. Before the game, Eastern Illinois was No. 356 out of 363 Division I teams in the KenPom rankings.
It was just the second win ever for Eastern Illinois against a Big Ten school. The Panthers, who are coached by former Indiana player Marty Simmons, beat Wisconsin in 1987. He played at Indiana from 1983 to 1985 before finishing his career at Evansville. This is his second season at Eastern Illinois.
The Panthers (4-9) shot 21-for-29 after intermission — 72 percent — including 4-of-8 from three-point range. Iowa, playing without veteran starters Kris Murray (left foot) and Connor McCaffery (left hand), went 2-of-17 behind the arc and 11-of-36 overall (31 percent).
Iowa is now 8-4 after its final nonconference game.
“It should linger, so it never happens again,"" said Iowa fifth-year senior Filip Rebraca, who finished with 24 points and eight rebounds.  ""We should always use it as motivation. We understand what happened tonight. So when we come back from break, we’ve got to understand this can never happen again.
""We didn’t respect them. Every opponent that comes in here, no matter what division … you respect them,"" Rebraca said. ""Every time you respect a player that means giving your all to play against them. And I just don’t think we did that.""
Iowa re-opens Big Ten play with road games at Nebraska and Penn State. Its next home game is against Indiana on Jan. 5.
According to ESPN Stats & Information research, Eastern Illinois became the first underdog of 30 or more points to win outright in the past 30 seasons.

The program is hopeful he will return this season.
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – The No. 18 Indiana basketball team will be without Xavier Johnson for an indefinite amount of time. 
The fifth-year point guard from Woodbridge, Va. underwent foot surgery on Wednesday to repair an injury he suffered on Saturday at Kansas. The program is hopeful he will return before the end of the season.

Johnson is second on the team with 9.9 points points per game, and he and leads the Hoosiers with 54 assists and 13 steals, while shooting 37.0% from 3-point range. Johnson transferred to Indiana before the 2021-22 season, an he received an All-Big Ten honorable mention last year. 
Without Johnson, Indiana will rely on freshman Jalen Hood-Schifino to run the point.

https://www.si.com/college/indiana/basketball/indiana-womens-basketball-defeats-butler-bulldogs-67-50-at-assembly-hall,Indiana Women's Basketball Remains Undefeated With 67-50 Win Over Butler,"The No. 4 Indiana women's basketball team moved to 12-0 on the season with a 67-50 win over Butler on Wednesday at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall. Mackenzie Holmes led the Hoosiers with 21 points, and coach Teri Moren was pleased with Lexus Bargesser's performance off the bench.
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – Indiana women's basketball took care of business on Wednesday afternoon, defeating the Butler Bulldogs 67-50.
Mackenzie Holmes scored the Hoosiers' first five points of the game, signaling another dominant afternoon. Butler was unable to stop Holmes from catching the ball deep in the paint, and she made the Bulldogs pay with 21 points. Holmes shot an efficient 8-for-12 from the field, including 4-for-4 from the free throw line. 
Indiana coach Teri Moren thought Holmes did a good job of being patient and kicking the ball out when the Butler double-team came. As the game went on, Moren and the Hoosiers noticed Butler's reluctancy to double-team Holmes a second time in the same possession, which led to easy looks through one-on-one coverage.
Holmes 17 first-half points helped Indiana build a 17-point halftime lead despite moments of sloppiness. The Hoosiers turned the ball over 16 times, their third-highest total of the season behind 18 turnovers against Bowling Green on Nov. 17 and 17 against Penn State on Dec. 8. Moren thought Indiana could have built a greater halftime led if not for these turnovers.
""The games before Christmas break are always interesting,"" Moren said. ""Way too many turnovers, just careless. At times I thought we were in a hurry. Maybe we were in a hurry to get home and open presents.""
Butler came out of the halftime locker room hungry for a comeback, going on an 11-4 run to start the third quarter. The Bulldogs trimmed Indiana's lead to 10 points for the first time since the 7:10 mark of the second quarter. But Indiana freshman Lexus Bargesser jumped off the bench with much-needed energy, scoring the game's next five points to stop the Butler run. Holmes added a pair of layups and Chloe Moore-McNeil scored with a minute left to cap off an 11-2 Indiana run.
Moren believes Bargesser is a freshman with plenty of upside, and she was happy with her production off the bench on Wednesday. 
""I think what helps us best is when we really push the floor,"" Bargesser said. ""When we're looking up the floor, trying to get run-outs, trying to get those easier points to get us going again.""
Rich Janzaruk/Herald-Times / USA TODAY NETWORK
And from that point on, Indiana cruised to its 12th win of the season. Despite losing star guard Grace Berger to a knee injury on Nov. 25, the No. 4 Hoosiers remain undefeated. Without Berger, Moren said each player is required to do a little bit more, but she's been overall pleased with Indiana's response to the injury.
""I'm not going to lie to you,"" Moren said. ""We're ready for Grace to be back.""
Following Holmes' lead, freshman Yarden Garzon scored 13 points on 4-for-11 shooting, Sydney Parrish added 10, Sara Scalia contributed nine and Bargesser finished with eight points, six rebounds, two assists, one block and one steal.
Next up for Indiana is a Dec. 29 road trip to Michigan State for a 3 p.m. ET tipoff. It's shaping up to be another impressive season for Moren and the Hoosiers, who have aspirations for a deep run in the NCAA Tournament. For Moren, who attended Seymour High School in Indiana, part of her has always wanted to lead the Indiana women's basketball program to relevancy.

BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – Welcome to Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall, where No. 4 Indiana hosts the Butler Bulldogs on Wednesday at 1 p.m. ET. Coach Teri Moren and the Hoosiers look to stay undefeated against a Butler team that enters today's matchup with a 5-6 record.

2:38 p.m. – FINAL: Indiana 67, Butler 50. Mackenzie Holmes leads all scorers with 21 points on 8-for-12 shooting, seven rebounds, three assists and a block. The Hoosiers move to 12-0 on the season.

2:25 p.m. – Indiana extends its lead to 22 points after back-to-back 3-pointers from Sara Scalia and Sydney Parrish, who has 10 points on 2-for-4 3-point shooting.  
2:17 p.m. – Indiana leads Butler 52-33 heading into the fourth quarter. Butler cut it to 10, but the Hoosiers responded by ending the third quarter on a 11-2 run behind baskets from Bargesser, Holmes and Moore-McNeil. 
2:14 p.m. – A great pass from Moore-McNeil to Holmes on a pick-and-roll makes it a 7-0 run to Indiana, extending the lead back to 17 points. Indiana has really locked in on defense in the latter part of this third quarter. McNeil sneaks another crafty pass into Holmes down low, who now has 21 points on 8-for-10 shooting. Butler has no answer for Holmes. 
2:05 p.m. – Sydney Jaynes finishes a layup through contact to trim Indiana's lead to 41-31 around the five-minute mark. This is Indiana's smallest lead since it was 26-16 at the 7:10 point of the second quarter. Moren calls a timeout after a Bargesser layup that puts the Hoosiers on top 43-31 with 4:26 left in the third. Indiana has 13 turnovers so far. 
2:02 p.m. – Indiana has four turnovers in the third quarter alone, and there's still six minutes left in the quarter. The Hoosiers have been really careless with the ball today, and coach Teri Moren is not happy. Indiana still holds a 41-29 lead and has played solid defense, but it's been far from a clean game for the Hoosiers. 
1:41 p.m. – Indiana outscored Butler 20-7 in the second quarter to take a 37-20 lead into halftime. The lead should probably be even bigger, but Indiana turned the ball over nine times in the first half. Mackenzie Holmes is leading the way with 17 points, followed by nine from Garzon. 
1:32 p.m. – Lilly Meister checks in for the first time today, giving Holmes a break. Scalia back in for Moore-McNeil, who just sunk a pair of free throws after being fouled driving to the lane. Lexus Bargesser hits Parrish in transition for an easy layup, and Butler calls timeout. Indiana is starting to pull away, leading 33-16 with 5:54 left in the half. 
1:24 p.m. – A hot start for Indiana to begin the second quarter results in a quick timeout for Butler. Back-to-back 3-pointers from Parrish and Garzon, plus an and-one from Holmes makes it a 9-0 Indiana run to start the quarter. Butler isn't offering much resistance on Holmes down low. 
1:20 p.m. – Indiana leads Butler 17-13 at the end of the first quarter. Garzon missed a pair of shots at the end of the half pretty badly, which is uncharacteristic for her. Holmes leads Indiana with seven points on 3-for-4 shooting and a free throw. 
1:18 p.m. – Garzon is 2-for-2 from 3 to start the game, upping Indiana's lead back to four points. Six turnovers plaguing Indiana early on. It's looked like some miscommunication on passes, but also just mis-handling the ball. 
1:15 p.m. – Butler ties the 9-9 on a 3-pointer from Wingler. That's a quick 5-0 run for the Bulldogs, who clearly came ready to play today. 
1:09 p.m. – Alyssa Geary and Henna Sandvik first off the bench for Indiana, replacing Scalia and Holmes. Scalia checks in briefly after, and Garzon takes a seat on the bench. Indiana a bit sloppy to start. That's four turnovers already. 
1:07 p.m. – Indiana out to an early 7-4 lead thanks to five points from Mackenzie Holmes. Parrish missed a layup in transition, but Holmes was there to clean it up and converted the and-one. 
12:58 p.m. – Starting lineup for Indiana: Sara Scalia, Yarden Garzon, Chloe Moore-McNeil, Sydney Parrish and Mackenzie Holmes.","Sports Illustrated Indiana Hoosiers News, Analysis and More","Teri moren, Indiana women's basketball, Chloe moore-mcneil, Basketball, Indiana hoosiers, Yarden garzon, Sydney parrish, Sara scalia, Mackenzie holmes",Jack ankony,"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 17:24:48 GMT","Indiana women's basketball (11-0) hosts the Butler Bulldogs (5-6) on Wednesday at 1 p.m. ET at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall.

Here's the full transcript of what Kopp and Gunn said after the game.
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – Miller Kopp had the hot hand at the start of Tuesday's game, scoring Indiana's first eight points against Elon.
CJ Gunn had an opportunity for more minutes with Xavier Johnson, Trayce Jackson-Davis and Jordan Geronimo out due to injury, and Gunn scored a career-high 11 points. 
Here's what Gunn and Kopp said after the game. 
— On what went right for Gunn on Tuesday:
Gunn: It felt good. Coach just always tells me and the other guys to just stay ready and be ready to hoop, and I feel like that's what I did today. Obviously I wanted to get in the game, so when I get the opportunity I'm going to play the best ball I can and do the things Coach asks me to do.
— On how Gunn approaches games like this:
Gunn: I'm just playing the game the right way. Last year I was used to playing against tiddlywinks, so now it's a different level. It's a different level of ball. I've just got to adjust to the game, and it comes with practicing hard and meshing with the guys, and that's how I look at it.
— On the team adjusting to new lineups and rotations:
Kopp: Well, I mean, in the season, it's a long season. If you think about it, we've got so many Big Ten games left, too. We're not looking ahead to that, but at the same time, that's a big part of the season is ahead. Honestly, it's about making guys come together. I always say, when the spider webs unite, you can tie up a lion. At the end of the day, it's just about getting guys to understand that we need everybody, and we're only as strong as our weakest link. Everybody is coming along for sure.
— On playing at Assembly Hall after two away games: 
Kopp: It was good. We love playing at home. We practice here every day pretty much, and this is a home gym for us. We feel most comfortable here. It's definitely good to be back.
— On Jalen Hood-Schifino's role with Xavier Johnson out: 
Kopp: Well, things definitely change with X out, a guy who's one of our leading scorers and one of our leaders, too, on the floor with the ball as well as with his voice. He's a big loss, but at the same time, 'Fino is definitely making strides. He makes strides every day. The kid is a relentless worker. At the end of the day, we're super comfortable with where he's at and where he's going.
— On CJ Gunn's performance:
Kopp: Well, one of the hardest things to do when you're coming in as a freshman is you want to please, you want to do well. At the same time, you have to learn what the coaches are asking of you and what the guys need from you. His role, just like when I was a freshman, might be different now than it is in two years. But right now, one of his goals, and he'll tell you, is just to get on the floor and get in the rotation. Really every day in practice he plays hard as ever. He talks, he's trying to do the right things. Yes, there are mess-ups, but at the same time, it all comes from a good place, and he's doing things at a thousand miles an hour. At the end of the day, as a guy who's been here for a while in college, it makes me happy to see a guy like CJ work so hard and continue to do things the right way because eventually it's going to build up, and he'll see the benefits for sure.","Sports Illustrated Indiana Hoosiers News, Analysis and More","Indiana basketball, Basketball, Cj gunn, Indiana hoosiers, Elon phoenix basketball, Miller kopp",Jack ankony,"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 04:59:32 GMT","Indiana freshman CJ Gunn scored a career-high 11 points, and Miller Kopp added 13 as the Hoosiers defeated Elon 96-72 on Tuesday at Assembly Hall.

Here's what coach Mike Woodson said after the game, with the full transcript and video attached.
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – With Xavier Johnson, Trayce Jackson-Davis and Jordan Geronimo out, Indiana coach Mike Woodson experimented with new lineups and rotations on Tuesday night against Elon.
Following a 96-72 win, here's what Woodson said in the postgame press conference. 
Woodson: Well, again, tonight everybody had a chance to play. Geronimo came to me before the game and said he couldn't go, and I knew Trayce wasn't going to play, and with X being out, guys have got to step up and play and make plays, and I thought for the most part everybody did that. I don't like the fact that we gave up 72 points; that's something I always seem to watch. We've got to be better in that area.
Woodson: No, he was solid tonight. I think moving forward, CJ and Gallo and Tamar Bates, Anthony when he gets in there, we've got to do a better job on the ball and guarding the ball. We had quite a few fouls called tonight in guarding the ball in a one-on-one position, and then we've got to do a better job in our pick-and-roll defense in terms of getting over the screen and getting into the ball. We were terrible tonight in that area.
Woodson: Well, I mean, it doesn't change anything. They both ran the offense. When X is there, it gives you two guys that can make plays with the basketball, not only for themselves but for guys around them. Now we don't have X. I've got to keep an eye on Jalen, as well. He's just getting back from his flare-up, and you want to make sure that you don't bury him with a lot of minutes to the point where he goes back down. Then you're really stuck. Tonight we came in, I came in with the thought process of playing him 30 minutes, and that's what we played him. I thought he responded pretty well. He had a few too many turnovers for me, but he's young and he's still learning. 
Woodson: I don't know. I wish I could tell you that. I really don't know. My job is to make sure that the guys that are in uniform, that's ready to play, to get them ready to go, and then we'll welcome them back when that time comes. 
Woodson: Well, again, we've played well here at home. Our fan base has put us in a position to play well. I expect us to win every game at home. That's my goal. Yes, to bounce back from the two games that we've lost is a confidence builder for our team. We're still a young team. Hell, I started two freshmen tonight. 
Woodson: Well, he's not in great shape. Logan has had his ups and downs, but I thought he responded. Logan, seemed like every time I throw him in there, he does something positive, but you can't play him in long stretches. He's had his problems in terms of illness and things of that nature that's really put him behind from a physical standpoint. I mean, tonight he played well, and I did play him in some stretches, but I've got to get him in better shape.
Woodson: No, his role -- again, he's going to have to continue to do the same thing. It's not like the NBA where I can go to the D-League and find me another point guard. He's the only true one that we have, and again, I just can't bury him with 40 minutes a game. I can't do that or there's a chance he could drop off. I've got to really watch that closely and monitor him as we continue this journey, but the guys like Gallo and Scoop and CJ and Anthony, guys that have to handle the ball for us, they've got to be more strong with it and be able to make basketball plays to help us.
Woodson: Well, Jordan's injury is a dislocated finger, and he tried to go a little yesterday. Trayce went a little yesterday, but then he had to -- he backed off, and we decided to just hold him out. I don't know if he'll play on Friday or not, as well. We'll see. With Geronimo it's basically how much pain he can tolerate with his dislocated finger bandaged. Time will tell. Tomorrow will be another day and we'll go start practice and see where everybody is.
Woodson: How hard they play. You know, that's a big part of it. Some of our guys are not playing hard enough. That's my job to get them to play hard. Everything else will come in play and fall in place if they learn to just play hard. That's what you deal with when you have young players. They think they play hard, but there's always another level that they've got to reach. That's what I'm trying to get them to.
