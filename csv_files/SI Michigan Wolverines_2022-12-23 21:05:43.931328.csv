Jim Harbaugh and Michigan want to run the ball well and often, there's no doubt about that, and obviously TCU head coach Sonny Dykes knows that. Dykes recently appeared on The Herd with Colin Cowherd and broke down his plan for slowing down the Wolverines.
""That's going to be the big challenge for us,"" Dykes said. ""Stopping the run and make the quarterback beat us. We've got to stop the run because that stops their offense.""
Two things here...
First, Michigan is currently 13-0 and ran for 243 yards and just under three touchdowns per game. When exactly did Dykes see Michigan's rushing attack and offense get stopped? Michigan's two lowest rushing outputs were 165 and 168 yards against Indiana and Illinois, respectively. Michigan ended up beating Indiana 31-10 and did skate past the Illini 19-17. Remember, Michigan was without Blake Corum for the second half of the Illinois game and was missing Donovan Edwards for much of the contest as well. The best, most talented teams on Michigan's schedule didn't slow down the rushing attack and neither will TCU.
Secondly, JJ McCarthy is more than capable of beating a team through the air, just ask Ohio State. Dykes did acknowledge McCarthy's ability, but he seems to think that the young sophomore might not be able to get it done against his Horned Frogs. McCarthy certainly got it done in Columbus before the running game exploded. Edwards did pop off two huge runs in the second half against OSU, but it was McCarthy's arm that diced up the Buckeyes before those long runs occurred. 
You can guarantee that McCarthy will hear these comments, take them to heart, meditate on them and then take it out on TCU. I do expect Michigan's running game to be very effective against the Horned Frogs, but I now expect McCarthy to shine even brighter than before on the second biggest stage in college football.

Devin Funchess was one of the highest-rated commits in Michigan Football's 2012 recruiting class. He saw immediate playing time in Ann Arbor as a true-freshman at the tight end position, earning All-Big Ten honorable mention during his freshman year. As a sophomore, Funchess was Michigan's second leading receiver and began experimenting at the wide receiver position. By the end of the 2013 season, Funchess was named Big Ten tight end of the year. 
Funchess would ultimately switch to the wide receiver position during his junior year in 2014, where he had his most productive season as a Wolverine. He finished the year with 62 receptions for 733 yards and four touchdowns, and entered his name into the NFL Draft at the conclusion of the season. 
A big prospect with a high upside, Funchess was selected in the second round of the 2015 NFL Draft by the Carolina Panthers. After four seasons with the Panthers, Funchess spent time with the Indianapolis Colts, Green Bay Packers, San Francisco 49ers and Detroit Lions. 
With his NFL playing days seemingly behind him, the 28-year old athlete is now setting his sights on a new goal - playing in the NBA. 
""I had to pick football in high school, but I was always hoopin,"" said Funchess on a recent podcast appearance. ""When it comes to my love and my passion, I love the game of basketball. As my transition is dwindling in the NFL being an eight year vet, I'm still 28 years old and I can still do something. I know I'd have to go overseas and play, get some film. But then after that, my main dream growing up was to play in the NBA, so that's my main goal and that's what I'm going to make happen.""
Admittedly, Funchess knows that it will be a significant challenge making the transition from the NFL to the NBA. When asked whether or not playing overseas was even necessary, Funchess was well aware that he'd need to prove himself before the NBA would be a realistic option. 
""I don't have any film, I haven't played basketball since 2010 on a real team. In 2020, I laced my shoes back up and have been going to work ever since then.""","Sports Illustrated Michigan Wolverines News, Analysis and More","Big ten, Michigan football, Football, Nba, Nfl, Devin funchess",Christopher breiler,"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 18:14:49 GMT","The former second round NFL Draft pick spent eight years in the league, and now he's set his sights on fulfilling another professional dream.",https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTc5MTU1MDk1OTg2OTA2ODcy/michigan-stadium.jpg

Today marks the early, December edition of National Signing Day that has essentially become the National Signing Day as somewhere between 70 and 80% of recruits put pen to paper and officially sign with the team of their choice. For Michigan, it was a relatively quiet day aside from landing two top-200 prospects in wide receiver Karmello English and cornerback Jyaire Hill. Once the dust settled on the first day of the period, Michigan sat at No. 17 nationally with 23 signees.
As for the current Wolverines, we're still all really excited to watch them take the field against TCU. So many people are curious about the matchups, especially the ones that involve Michigan's running game and TCU's rush defense. Most expect Donovan Edwards to have a big day and for U-M to improve to 14-0 and advance to the national title game.","Sports Illustrated Michigan Wolverines News, Analysis and More","Football, Michigan wolverines, Tcu, Tcu horned frogs, College football playoff, Jim harbaugh, Michigan football",Brandon brown,"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 03:39:33 GMT",Michigan has put a bow on the early signing period as the current Wolverines prepare for the showdown with TCU.,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NjE0NDg2OTAzMDM5MTM4/podcast-thumbnail.jpg

Despite dropping a top five just two days ago that was made up of Florida, Illinois, Purdue, Kentucky and Missouri, big time defensive back prospect Jyaire Hill announced his commitment to Michigan at his high school on National Signing Day.
The 6-1, 170-pounder out of Kankakee (Ill.) High School had been highest on the Wolverines and Illini throughout his recruitment with U-M seemingly leading the way throughout. Then, the versatile athlete put out a top five that didn't include the Wolverines only to pick the maize and blue at his commitment ceremony.
Recruiting has always had a bit of a rollercoaster element, which some people enjoy, while others hate. Wherever you fall on the love-hate scale of recruiting, no one is going to enjoy when a prospect intentionally releases a top five without the school he actually plans to commit to. 
Whatever went into Hill's thought process, he's now a Wolverine and a highly-ranked one at that. Per the 247 Sports Composite, Hill is considered the No. 195 overall player in the country and is listed as an athlete because of his playmaking ability at wide receiver as well as cornerback. He brings Michigan's 2023 class total to 23 players and should put the Wolverines inside the top 20 as the staff prepares to chase a few more big fish into the February edition of NSD.","Sports Illustrated Michigan Wolverines News, Analysis and More","Class of 2023, Jyaire hill, Jim harbaugh, Recruiting, Michigan football recruiting, Michigan football, Athlete, Cornerback, Michigan wolverines",Brandon brown,"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 21:51:55 GMT",Michigan's signing day went off without a hitch.,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NDkyMzQ3Njk2ODE3NjY5/commitment.jpg

Michigan running back Blake Corum has a big decision to make, and he's got less than a month to make it. After a phenomenal junior season, the unanimous First-Team All-American needs to decide whether or not to return for his senior season, or to declare for the NFL Draft. 
Corum, the Ameche-Dayne Big Ten Running Back of the Year, was firmly in the Heisman trophy discussion for much of the 2022 season. Unfortunately, a late season injury against Illinois would ultimately derail his Heisman campaign and essentially bring his season to an end.  Corum finished his junior year with 1463 yards and 18 touchdowns on 247 attempts. 
Appearing on a recent podcast with NFL Insider Adam Schefter, Corum provided some insight into his through process regarding a return to Michigan, or a decision to enter his name into the NFL Draft.
""I'm still trying to figure that out,"" Corum said. ""A lot has been happening recently with the injury and, you know, I've thought about it a little bit. But right now I'm just trying to figure some things out, get my knee right. I have a couple of weeks before I have to decide on what's best for me and what I should do, so I'm going to try and put some puzzle pieces together and see what's best.""
""I'm 50/50, I have not made a decision. It's a hard decision, and like I said, I've got to think about what's best for Blake Corum."" 
Here's a brief look at Corum's accomplishments during his junior season at Michigan, courtesy of MGoBlue.com:

As things stand right now, Michigan is favored by 7.5 points over TCU in the semifinal round of the College Football Playoffs. The Horned Frogs played with fire all year long and came out on top week after week until playing Kansas State for the second time in the Big 12 Championship game. Because of that, some think that they just have a knack for getting wins. Most people, however, see Michigan as a really bad matchup for TCU that will result in another dominant performance by the Wolverines. All of that, and more, is discussed in the video below.","Sports Illustrated Michigan Wolverines News, Analysis and More","Football, Michigan wolverines, College football playoff, Jim harbaugh, Michigan football, Tcu, Tcu horned frogs, Sonny dykes",Brandon brown,"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 07:22:22 GMT","TCU is a solid team that made it 12 weeks without losing a game, but it just feels like they're severely outmatched against Michigan.",https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NTk0ODg2NTUxMzQ4NzYw/ronnie-bell-mel-pearson.jpg

The Michigan Football program has been on a roll when it comes to producing legitimate Heisman trophy candidates as of late. Last season, it was Aidan Hutchinson who made the trip to New York for the Heisman trophy ceremony - finishing with the second most votes behind Alabama's Bryce Young. 
In 2022, Michigan running back Blake Corum inserted himself into the Heisman discussion for much of the season. Unfortunately, a late season injury prevented Corum establishing himself as not only a finalist for the trophy, but as a player who had a legitimate shot at capturing the hardware based on the finalists who actually did receive an invite. 
Looking ahead to 2023, PFF College is already placing two Wolverines on its way-to-early Top 10 Heisman candidates list: quarterback JJ McCarthy and running back Donovan Edwards. 
Both McCarthy and Edwards have proven that they have all of the traits necessary to win the coveted award. Physical toughness, mental toughness, elite athleticism, and both play for a program that has won back-to-back conference championships - along with two-consecutive trips to the college football playoff. 
Here's a look at McCarthy's accomplishments so far this season (2022)

It remains to be seen whether or not offensive lineman Zak Zinter will return for his senior season at Michigan, but his impact on the football field is unquestionable. As a critical piece of the best offensive line in college football, Zinter has established himself as a dominant force at the right guard position. As it turns out, Zinter is also a dominant force in the classroom as well - as evidenced by earning the title of Academic All-American.
From MGoBlue.com:
Zinter has maintained a grade-point average of 3.549 while studying sport management in U-M's School of Kinesiology. The North Andover, Mass., native is in his third year academically and was an Academic All-Big Ten honoree last fall in his first year of eligibility. An All-Big Ten (second team) pick in 2021, Zinter has appeared in 32 games with 30 starts in his career.
As a true freshman, Zinter appeared in six games and made four starts at the right guard position. The following season, Zinter (a sophomore) earned a starting and made 12 starts over the course of 13 games - helping lead the Wolverines to a win over Ohio State, a Big Ten Championship and a spot in the College Football Playoff in 2021. The offensive line also earned the title of being the best offensive line in the country that season, winning the Joe Moore award for the first time since the trophy's inception (2015). Zinter would retain his starting role during his junior season in 2022, starting all 13 games (so far) at the right guard position. Once again, the offensive line would capture the coveted Joe Moore award - becoming the first program to win the award in back-to-back seasons. ","Sports Illustrated Michigan Wolverines News, Analysis and More","Big ten, Joe moore award, Football, Michigan football, Michigan wolverines",Christopher breiler,"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 23:19:42 GMT","He's a critical piece to the best offensive line in college football, but he's also getting the job done in the classroom as well.",https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyMjY0NjMwMzAxNjk3MjYw/inshot_20220911_143451110.jpg
