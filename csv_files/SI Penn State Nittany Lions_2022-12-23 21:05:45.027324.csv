https://www.si.com/college/pennstate/football/penn-state-football-2023-recruiting-class-transfer-portal,Penn State's Recruiting Class Isn't Finished,"The Lions continue to pursue players for the 2023 class, including through the Transfer Portal
Recruiting never stops, and neither does Penn State coach James Franklin. Even on Signing Day, the Lions were offering scholarships to players for the 2023 recruiting class and beyond.
Penn State on Wednesday welcomed 22 players to the 2023 class, which ranks 14th nationally, according to Sports Illustrated. Though Franklin said he's ""very, very happy"" with the class, he certainly believes it can improve. 
We've explored whether Penn State will look for a quarterback in the portal, but Franklin will address other pressing needs first.
Penn State loses its top two receivers in Parker Washington and Mitchell Tinsley. The Rose Bowl will present an opportunity for KeAndre Lambert-Smith, Harrison Wallace III and Liam Clifford to launch a 2023 campaign to replace them. But the Lions are looking for experience as well from the transfer portal.
Penn State has offered scholarships to multiple receivers in the portal. Among the leading candidates is Kent State's Dante Cephas, who caught 48 passes for 744 yards this season. On Thursday the Lions extended an offer to Troy's Tez Johnson, who caught 56 passes for 863 yards.
""That's a position where I could see us signing a couple more guys just to make sure that we have the competition at that position on a similar scale that we do at tight end and running back,"" Franklin said. ""I think that's going to be important for us moving forward.""
The Lions appear well positioned at tackle, with All-Big Ten standout Olu Fashanu returning and freshman Drew Shelton playing well while Fashanu was injured. But coaches never can have too many tackles, since it's the most difficult position to scout and develop.
Further, tackles Caedan Wallace and Bryce Effner have not announced their intentions for next season, so Franklin is looking for experience.
""We'd like to get another offensive lineman if we could, specifically an offensive tackle, or a guy that's like the guys that we signed in this class that have position flexibility,"" Franklin said. ""... Offensive tackles that are still out there, wide receivers that are still out there, we'll be in pursuit.""
The Lions rotate often across their defensive line, which means they're always in the market for production. Three of the Lions' top-producing portal players have been defensive linemen: end Arnold Ebiketie and tackle Derrick Tangelo in 2021 and end Chop Robinson in 2022.
In particular, the Lions would like to find an experienced tackle with PJ Mustipher's size and mobility. Further, Franklin said he's continuing to scout defensive backs, even though the position is stacked with young talent. On Thursday the Lions lost longtime commit Conrad Hussey, a 4-star safety, to Florida State. 
""On the defensive side of the ball, we'd like to get a defensive tackle, possibly another defensive end just from a numbers perspective,"" Franklin said. ""And depending on how this thing plays out in the back end as defensive back, we could be in the need for one or two more defensive backs.
""We'll see how this whole thing plays out. But those would be probably needs that I would say that are still out there that we'd like to try to address either through the second signing day with high school prospects or some transfer portal prospects.""

https://www.si.com/college/pennstate/football/penn-state-football-rose-bowl-tickets-utah,The Latest on Rose Bowl Ticket Availability,"Looking for Rose Bowl tickets to see Penn State vs. Utah? Here's an updated glimpse at pricing and availability.
Penn State and Utah have sold out their Rose Bowl ticket allotments, sending most buyers to the secondary market. As the Jan. 2 game approaches, ticket prices are trending downward.
The starting price for Rose Bowl tickets was $124 on Dec. 22, according to SI Tickets, about $25 lower than the previous week. Prices will fluctuate as the game approaches but have fallen in recent weeks.
Prices at SI Tickets are comparable with those of other resellers, including Tickemaster, which runs the Rose Bowl public ticket sale.
No. 11 Penn State (10-2) is playing in its fifth Rose Bowl and first since the 2016 season. No. 8 Utah (10-3) is playing in its second consecutive Rose Bowl as the Pac-12 champion. The matchup is the first between the teams. Utah is a 2-point favorite, according to SI Sportsbook.
""I think if you're a true football guy and you watch them, that's what a team is supposed to look like, in my opinion,"" Penn State coach James Franklin said of Utah. ""Offense, defense, special teams, complementary football there. Tough football team there. They're a physical football team. They know how to win games in a lot of different ways. I've got a bunch of respect for them.""
Most of Penn State's roster will play in the Rose Bowl with only two starters currently scheduled to miss the game. All-American cornerback Joey Porter Jr., who missed two November games with appendicitis, announced he will forgo for the bowl and enter the 2023 NFL Draft. Parker Washington, the team's leading receiver who missed the final two games with an injury, will enter the draft as well.
Otherwise, many players said they view the Rose Bowl as an opportunity.
""I've been here for five years, and myself and the team has put in a lot of work over that time, been through a lot of adversity, and so what better way to go out on top than at the Rose Bowl?"" senior defensive tackle PJ Mustipher said. ""The opportunity is truly a blessing, but to get a win would mean a whole lot to this program in getting us right back on track.""  
Added senior safety Ji'Ayir Brown, ""Why wouldn't I play in this game, since I watched it growing up? This is the granddaddy of them all.""  
Kickoff for the Rose Bowl is scheduled for 5:10 p.m. EST on Jan. 2. ESPN will televise.

https://www.si.com/college/pennstate/football/penn-state-football-2023-recruiting-class-first-impressions,First Impressions of Penn State's 2023 Recruiting Class,"James Franklin sees standouts, sleepers and steals in his new group of Nittany Lions.
Penn State signed 22 players to its 2023 recruiting class, which may or may not be finished, according to coach James Franklin.
The Lions have plenty of needs, Franklin said Wednesday, notably at wide receiver and offensive tackle. They're also awaiting the final decision of one long-time commit.
Here's a glimpse at Penn State's 2023 recruiting class and what it brings to the program.
Penn State followed its superb 2022 class, which produced Big Ten freshman of the year Nicholas Singleton, with another standout group. The two highest-ranked signees are offensive linemen: 5-star tackle J'Ven Williams from Wyomissing (Pa.) High and 4-star lineman Alex Birchmeier of Broad Run (Va.) High.
""We're very, very happy with the class,"" Penn State coach James Franklin said. ""There's a lot of balance in the class, offense and defense, as well as early enrollees. ... The class is about split from offense to defense, from little guys to big guys. I think we’ve got a really good mix there.""
Offensive lineman J'Ven Williams is the highest-ranked player of Penn State's class, earning 5-star grades from 247Sports and On3. He's the No. 1 player in Pennsylvania and the top-ranked interior lineman nationally.
Williams played at Wyomissing High, where he was the conference player of the year and a two-time all-state selection. He also broke the Pennsylvania Class 2A shot-put record formerly held by Joe Kovacs, a Penn State grad and two-time world shot-put champion.
Penn State's 2022 class made an immediate impact behind running backs Singleton and Kaytron Allen, linebacker Abdul Carter, offensive lineman Drew Shelton and defensive linemen Zane Durant and Dani Dennis-Sutton. Quarterback Drew Allar also established himself as the No. 2 behind Sean Clifford.
Franklin hinted that the 2023 class could deliver similar production.
""By the time we got to the midpoint of the season, some of [the 2022 recruits] were playing at a really high level,"" Franklin said. ""There started to be a buzz not only in the conference but nationally about some of those guys. We feel the same way about this class.
""... We'll see how it plays out. What I always say is, I hope that these guys turn out to be who we think they are and then I hope we got lucky on two or three.""
Tony Rojas: The 6-2, 195-pound linebacker needs to gain mass but could make a quick impact on the defensive depth chart. He had a monster senior season at Fairfax (Va.) High, making 72 tackles, 13 sacks and five forced fumbles. Rojas also rushed for 2,239 yards and 35 touchdowns, demonstrating his two-way skill.
King Mack: The 4-star safety helped St. Thomas Aquinas to its third consecutive state title in Florida, making 58 tackles and two interceptions. He returned one for a touchdown. The Lions certainly are comfortable breaking in young players to their secondary.
Alex Birchmeier: He's the No. 2-ranked player in Penn State's class, a versatile offensive lineman who can play all three interior positions. In fact, he might be able to play all five; Franklin said he's interesting in testing Birchmeier at tackle. But the freshman certainly could find his way onto the interior depth chart.
Andrew Rappleyea: One of three tight ends in the class, the Milton (Mass.) Academy standout will draw comparisons to Pat Freiermuth. Rappleyea is a ready-to-play 6-4, 235 pounds with the ability to compete in a deep room.
Jaxon Smolik: Franklin called the class' lone quarterback a ""steal"" nationally. Franklin watched Smolik, who will enroll early from Iowa's Dowling Catholic, play on a cold, rainy night this fall. ""It didn't even faze him,"" Franklin said. 
London Montgomery: The running back from Scranton (Pa.) Prep missed his senior season with a torn ACL and likely will be eased into drills next year. However, he rushed for 2,356 yards and 36 touchdowns as a junior, and Franklin predicted Montgomery could have rushed for 3,000 this year. ""I think you're the best-kept secret in this recruiting class,"" Franklin told Montgomery during the team's Signing Day livestream. ""I don't think people have any idea what we’ve got coming to Penn State.""
Ty Blanding: A 3-star defensive tackle from New York's Christ the King, Blanding is a player ""nobody's talking about,"" Franklin said. ""I think sometimes New York is under-recruited,"" Franklin said. ""People view it as a basketball state, but there's been a bunch of really good players come out of that state. He's a guy, when I watch his tape, I'm like I don't understand why more people are not talking about this guy.""
The Lions unofficially have 23 players committed to the 2023 class, with one signature still outstanding. Florida safety Conrad Hussey, a St. Thomas Aquinas teammate King Mack, has yet to sign after receiving further attention from Florida State and Miami.

https://www.si.com/college/pennstate/football/penn-state-football-james-franklin-nil-wild-wild-west,"Penn State's James Franklin Calls NIL 'the Wild, Wild West'","Franklin and other coaches seek guardrails and guidance regarding NIL, particularly in recruiting.
Penn State's James Franklin has talked plenty with fellow coaches about how Name, Image and Likeness has changed recruiting. The consensus isn't positive.
Sure, most coaches support NIL itself as an opportunity for college athletes to profit off the games that profit off them. However, Franklin said that the lack of an NIL rulebook is hurting college football.
""I think there’s major concerns with what’s going on in college football right now,"" Franklin said Wednesday. ""There’s just really no guardrails, not a whole lot of guidance, not a whole lot of governance. And it's concerning.""
Franklin discussed NIL and Penn State on Signing Day while introducing the 22 players of his 2023 recruiting class who signed their Letters of Intent early. NIL might be preventing the class from being larger.
Penn State Athletic Director Patrick Kraft said recently that the program has lost potential recruits because of NIL offers elsewhere. He called that a space where Penn State won't participate.
""What you are hearing in the recruiting space is, and it happened with us just this week, people just won't come,"" Kraft said in mid-December. ""They're throwing half a million dollars or $700,000 if you come to X school. We're not going to do that. That's just not how it works.""
Franklin reiterated his support for NIL opportunities that give athletes the opportunity to earn money, represent a business or build their own. But he said NIL's impact on recruiting has produced some ""crazy"" conversations between players and coaches.
Without clear NIL guidelines from a collegiate governing body like the NCAA, Franklin said the scene has become ""a little bit of the wild, wild west.""
""Some of the conversations that are happening are crazy, and they've gotten down to the 11th hour of this,"" Franklin said. ""It got as crazy as I've seen in my 26 years [of coaching and recruiting]. That's important. We're going to have to come up with a solution for college athletics as a whole and we're going to come up with a solution specifically for football.""
Three NIL collectives are involved with Penn State athletics, including the football-only group Lions Legacy Club. Representatives of all three said their primary purpose is to support current athletes. None plans to get involved in recruiting.
""We’re not going out and promising crazy contracts or anything like that. We’re not having any conversations like that,"" said Chris Ganter, executive director of Lions Legacy Club. ""It’s about building that foundation and taking care of the financial well-being and business mindset of these players who are here.""
However, as Kraft noted, NIL collectives surrounding other programs are helping to build recruiting classes through deal-making. Kraft and Franklin said they want to create NIL opportunities for athletes through Penn State's large alumni network.
""I think this is what gives us an advantage,"" Kraft said. ""We're Penn State. We're so big and powerful, and our alums are so engaged. It's harnessing that to help us in the recruiting front.""
Franklin once again said that Penn State began its NIL program ""way behind"" other schools. Men's basketball coach Micah Shrewsberry told Nate Bauer of Blue-White Illustrated that his program ranks 13th or 14th in the Big Ten regarding NIL.
Franklin credited Kraft and Penn State President Neeli Bendapudi for understanding and addressing the issues. Penn State's NIL initiatives must continue growing, Franklin said.
""I think we've made up a lot of ground,"" Franklin said. ""But we still have a lot of work to do if we say we want to approach NIL and everything else when it comes to competing at the highest level.""
Kraft agreed, saying that he doesn't ""lose as much sleep"" over NIL as he did upon becoming athletic director in May. He added, though, that the athletic department is ""just scratching the surface"" of what NIL will become.
""I think you have to find a sustainable model,"" Kraft said. ""What we have right now is not a sustainable model. ... There's a lot of misinformation on what people are being offered. And I think you're going to find as time goes on, 'Wait, they told me I was going to get X, and now I'm not.'
""So I think that's this new NIL world that we're living in. We're still trying to find our way through it.""

https://www.si.com/college/pennstate/football/penn-state-football-mourns-the-loss-of-star-running-back-franco-harris,Penn State Mourns the Loss of Franco Harris,"'Franco was a true steward of the Blue & White,' Penn State coach James Franklin said.
Franco Harris, who began his legendary Hall of Fame career in the Penn State backfield, died Wednesday. He was 72.
Harris played running back at Penn State for three seasons, rushing for 2,002 yards and 24 touchdowns in a backfield that included All-American Lydell Mitchell. Harris played with linebacker Jack Ham at Penn State and with the Pittsburgh Steelers, where the two embarked on Pro Football Hall of Fame careers. 
Harris was inducted in 1990, Ham in 1988. They are among six Lions inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Penn State coach James Franklin called it a ""huge loss for football in general, for college football, the NFL, Penn State and really Pennsylvania.""
Franklin added that Harris was ""a true steward of the blue and white."" 
""He was really an ambassador for the university and the football program,"" Franklin said during his National Signing Day press conference Wednesday. ""He was a servant leader. Every time I had a chance to be around him I was just so impressed with him and his wife [Dana]. Obviously he was very involved with a lot of different causes throughout the state of Pennsylvania. He was just an amazing human being.""
Harris was named MVP of Super Bowl IX, in which he rushed for a then-Super Bowl record 158 yards and a touchdown in the Steelers' 16-6 win over Dallas. Harris rushed for 1,000 yards eight times in his career and joined Ham on the NFL's All-Decade Team of the 1970s. The Steelers are scheduled to retire Harris' jersey Saturday during a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Immaculate Reception.
""As a child growing up in the Midwest, Franco Harris was a legendary figure, who I was always enamored with,"" Penn State Athletic Director Patrick Kraft said in a statement. ""When I was blessed to join the Penn State family earlier this year, I was fortunate enough to get to know Franco and his wife, Dana, very well. They have been so gracious with their kindness and support. Franco was known for his grit and unrelenting style on the field but his compassion, warmth, generosity off the field will leave a lasting impression on me. I am heartbroken for all who loved him. We have lost a true legend and friend.""
Former Penn State assistant coach Jay Paterno posted a statement from his mother Sue. Harris passed away on what would have been Joe Paterno's 96th birthday:
""We are all saddened by the sudden loss of Franco Harris. His death is not only a loss for his family and friends but also for Penn State, The Steelers, Pittsburgh and the countless people for whom he was an example of a life well-lived. 
""For many he was a man of miracles, the man who showed up at the right time to lift a franchise and a city to greatness in one incredible play. 
""But his life was about so much more than the game, what he did with that moment was even more inspiring. 
""He poured himself forth to a life of service to others. He was an example of integrity, selflessness, and loyalty.
""Perhaps most fitting is that the indelible image of him reaching down to make that catch, to save the day, is symbolic of a big man reaching down to lift others he could help.
""It is that life of care, loyalty and service that will forever shine in our hearts.
""Our hearts go out to Dana, Dok and his family and friends across the years who came to know and love a symbol of the very best of Penn State, Pittsburgh and this country.""

https://www.si.com/college/pennstate/football/penn-state-football-signing-day-quarterback-jaxon-smolik-signs,"In Jaxon Smolik, Penn State Signed the 'Steal' of the Quarterback Class","Smolik bet on himself, camping at Penn State without a scholarship offer. Then he earned one. 'He's a winner, man.'
Penn State welcomed quarterback Jaxon Smolik to its 2023 recruiting class with flourish from its current quarterbacks and some high praise from head coach James Franklin.
Quarterbacks Sean Clifford, Drew Allar and Beau Pribula introduced Smolik during Penn State's Signing Day livestream Wednesday, after which Franklin outlined what the signing meant to him.
""You're the steal of the class in terms of this quarterback class in high school,"" Franklin said.
Penn State signed Smolik, a three-star prospect from Iowa's Dowling Catholic High, as the lone quarterback in its 2023 class (so far, potentially). Franklin and offensive coordinator Mike Yurcich highlighted how Smolik earned the scholarship and changed the class.
Smolik, an all-state quarterback who threw for 1,967 yards and 19 touchdowns as a senior, initially had committed to Tulane. Then the Lions lost a previously committed quarterback,  leaving them searching. 
Meanwhile, Smolik (6-1, 205) was rising. He was a standout at the Elite 11 Finals in California, ranking as the No. 8 player in the field, according to Sports Illustrated. That performance helped Smolik earn an invitation to a July camp at Penn State, where he earned a scholarship offer. He committed in August.
""You really did it the hard way,"" Yurcich told Smolik during the Signing Day ceremony. ""You willed your way into this position. You came here to camp without an offer, which is unique in this day and age, and you balled out and got the offer.""
Yurcich noted how Smolik missed much of his junior season with an injury and later played through pain, which Yurcich called ""a very important trait.""
""When you look at his story and what he’s had to overcome — playing through injury his junior season, playing through pain and playing at a high level — and then he came here without an offer, we told him he had to camp, he had to ball out, and he did. He's as solid as they come,"" Yurcich told Signing Day host Brian Tripp in an interview. ""... He's a a winner, man.""
Rivals ranks Smolik as the nation's No. 17 quarterback, while ESPN lists him at No. 29 and 247Sports at No. 33. Yurcich, however, went beyond the rankings to underscore Franklin's point about Smolik being a ""steal"" of the class.
""When talent meets talent, because everybody’s going to be talented in the Big Ten, something else has to take over,"" Yurcich said. ""That’s the discipline, that’s the hard work, that’s the character and that’s the competitiveness that’s inside the chest. And he excels at all of those things.
""It’s not just who’s the prettiest guy in shorts throwing the ball in 7-on-7. It's about the gritty stuff. That goes a long way.""
Yurcich told Smolik that, ""we're going to need you to compete pronto."" Smolik will enroll in January and quickly become an integral part of the offense as the third quarterback in the room. He explained why he's ready.
""It's my demeanor, my willingness not to quit,"" Smolik said on the Signing Day livestream. ""I learned that I have a lot in me, I have a lot in the tank. When I think I can't go anymore, I can go a lot more. It means a lot to me that they took a chance on me and decided to offer me at that camp.""

https://www.si.com/college/pennstate/football/penn-state-football-james-franklin-on-quarterback-recruiting,Will Penn State Pursue Another Quarterback?,"The Lions have three scholarship QBs set for 2023. James Franklin would like to add another, which won't be easy.
After the Rose Bowl, Penn State will find itself in a unique position at quarterback. The Lions return two scholarship quarterbacks, and a third will enroll in January. But that raises a question: Do they need to find another quarterback in the NCAA Transfer Portal?
Penn State coach James Franklin would say yes, but he understands how difficult that will be.
""You prefer to have more than three, there's no doubt about it,"" Franklin said. ""I think if you look across the country, whenever you're in a situation where your starter is a sophomore or less, ... it really is a hard sell.""
For all the excitement about Penn State's 2023 quarterback situation, the team enters next season low on scholarship arms — at least from Franklin's perspective. The head coach has said he prefers to have at least four, and perhaps, five scholarship quarterbacks on a single roster with varied levels of eligibility. That gives the room a diverse blend of experience and leadership voices.
However, in the NCAA Transfer Portal era, quarterback is the toughest position to maintain. Penn State recently lost redshirt freshman quarterback Christian Veilleux, who transferred to Pitt. Before him, then-backups Will Levis and Tommy Stevens transferred as well.
That leaves 2022 freshmen Drew Allar and Beau Pribula as the two returning scholarship quarterbacks on the roster. Penn State's coaching staff has made clear how it feels about Allar, elevating him to the backup role and playing him in 10 games this season.
Yet fellow freshman Beau Pribula isn't conceding the starting role in 2023.
""Beau is an unbelievable quarterback and person,"" Penn State offensive coordinator Mike Yurcich said. ""And his inner drive, that competitiveness, is as good as I’ve ever been around. … With continued opportunities, he’s going to continue to impress us. He’s gonna seize the moment.""
Still, it's a young group that will add true freshman Jaxon Smolik, who plans to enroll in January. However, quarterbacks in the portal might look at that room and see little opportunity. Perhaps one will be content transferring to Penn State as a role player.
As Franklin said, though, that's a tough sell. And does Penn State want to sign a portal quarterback content to be a backup anyway?
""Sometimes you can convince an older player that just wants to be a part of a big-time program and part of a special experience to come as more of a backup, a senior backup, a veteran backup. Sometimes you can find that,"" Franklin said. ""More times than not, the guys that you're going to want [also] want to go somewhere to play and be the guy and compete.
""That's always a challenge when you're starting a true freshman, a redshirt freshman. You may start a true freshman and have five quarterbacks on your roster, but after the season ends your room is going to change dramatically.""
Franklin is familiar with having just three scholarship quarterbacks, which happened in 2021, when Veilleux and Ta'Quan Roberson backed Clifford. The coach likely doesn't want to repeat that situation but might not have a choice. 
The early signing period begins Wednesday, and Penn State seems unlikely to add another quarterback in this recruiting class. The team could add a preferred walk-on to take reps and expand the room, or it might be patient with the portal and see who's available after spring drills. 
In the meantime, Allar and Pribula will take center stage.
Penn State meets Utah in the Rose Bowl, which kicks off at 5:10 p.m. EST on Jan. 2. ESPN will televise.

https://www.si.com/college/pennstate/football/penn-state-football-nick-tarburton-rose-bowl-nfl-draft,Penn State's Nick Tarburton Declares for NFL Draft,"The defensive end will play in the Rose Bowl before entering the 2023 draft.
Nick Tarburton, one of Penn State's most veteran defensive players, will enter the 2023 NFL Draft after playing in the Rose Bowl. Tarburton announced his decision this weekend in a social-media post.
""My time here at Penn State has been nothing short of special,"" Tarburton wrote in an Instagram post. ""Although it has never been easy, Penn State shaped me into the man I am today. There will always be a special place in my heart for Happy Valley & all that it has to offer.""

View the original article to see embedded media.

Tarburton is the third Penn State player to declare for the NFL Draft, joining cornerback Joey Porter Jr. and receiver Parker Washington. A fifth-year senior, Tarburton was eligible to return for a bonus COVID season. Instead, he chose to enter the draft to cap a career in which he will play 35 games.
Tarburton started all 12 regular-season games at defensive end,  making 5.5 tackles for loss and 2 sacks. He also had a hand in two turnovers against Northwestern, forcing and recovering separate fumbles.
Tarburton played through multiple injuries during his career, prompting head coach James Franklin to reference Tarburton's toughness and resilience often over the past few years. The defensive end played about as healthy as ever this season, contributing in a positional rotation with Chop Robinson and Adisa Isaac.
""He's one of those guys who maybe doesn't get the fanfare of some others,"" Franklin said earlier this season, ""but he is a critical piece of our locker room and of our team.""
Tarburton will spend the winter getting to know NFL teams. NFL Draft Bible does not list Tarburton among its prospects at defensive end or outside linebacker for the 2023 NFL Draft. However, he's a veteran who will benefit from offseason training and a potential invitation to the NFL combine.
In the meantime, Tarburton said his mindset is ""Rose Bowl, Rose Bowl, Rose Bowl right now.""
Penn State will play Utah in the Rose Bowl, which kicks off at 5:10 p.m. EST on Jan. 2. ESPN will televise.

https://www.si.com/college/pennstate/football/penn-state-football-expects-few-opt-outs-for-rose-bowl,Penn State Goes All In on the Rose Bowl,"Few Lions are opting out of the Rose Bowl. As one player said, 'It's not the same as any bowl.'
Like everyone else, Penn State players watched Saquon Barkley run for 194 yards in the 2017 Rose Bowl and the legendary Texas-USC game of 2006. They revere the game's history and legacy. That's why the overwhelming majority of Penn State's roster plans to play in the 2023 Rose Bowl against Utah.
""Why wouldn't I play in this game, since I watched it growing up?"" safety Ji'Ayir Brown said. ""This is the granddaddy of them all.""
For Penn State, this bowl season looks quite different than the last. The Lions' Rose Bowl roster will look very similar to the one that finished the regular season with four consecutive wins. In fact, it might include a few extra players who had been injured. 
Just two starters are out for the game, both of whom had late-season health issues. All-American cornerback Joey Porter Jr., who missed two games with appendicitis, announced he will forgo the game and enter the 2023 NFL Draft. Parker Washington, Penn State's leading receiver, is out as well, having missed the final two games with an injury. He will enter the draft.
But nearly everyone else is expected to make the trip to Pasadena. That includes captains Brown, PJ Mustipher, Juice Scruggs and Sean Clifford; sixth-year receiver Mitchell Tinsley and potential early draft entrants Brenton Strange, Theo Johnson and Adisa Isaac. Defensive end Nick Tarburton said that he will play in the Rose Bowl before entering the draft.
That's far different from last year, when six starters opted out of the Outback Bowl against Arkansas. Actually, though, coach James Franklin considered that season as the outlier.
""This is who we've been,"" Franklin said at the team's bowl media event in State College. ""In my 12 years as a head coach, I've never had an opt-out until last year. I think part of it goes back to the leadership of our captains this year. That was a big part of our conversation before the season that started with our captains: what their expectations were, what their standards were, what mine were as well.
""And really the way, in my mind, we've billed it at Penn State is, there's really no reason to opt out. We will be flexible with all of our guys. I want our guys to be as successful as they possibly can. I want the bowl experience to be a great experience. We'll work with our guys. There's really no reason to opt out.""
The Rose Bowl seems to have impacted a few decisions. As the value of bowl games is diminishing, the Rose Bowl evidently carries weight at Penn State. Several players discussed watching the game as kids, calling it a ""dream"" to play there someday.
This also might be the last Rose Bowl in its current incarnation. The bowl will host a College Football Playoff semifinal next year, then enter the rotation for a 12-team playoff beginning in 2024.
""I've been here for five years, and myself and the team has put in a lot of work over that time, been through a lot of adversity, and so what better way to go out on top than at the Rose Bowl?"" Mustipher, a senior defensive tackle, said. ""The opportunity is truly a blessing, but to get a win would mean a whole lot to this program in getting us right back on track.""
Added Tinsley, a sixth-year receiver who transferred to Penn State from Western Kentucky, ""It's definitely a dream come true to play in the Rose Bowl. And I'm going to finish what I started with this team.""
Franklin added further good roster news. He said that offensive linemen Olu Fashanu and Caedan Wallace could play in the bowl game after missing significant time with injuries. Fashanu already has announced that he will return to Penn State next season, giving the Lions' a potential first-round left tackle for one more year.
In addition, Franklin said that running back Keyvone Lee could play in the Rose Bowl as well. Lee, who started the first two games and caught the game-winning touchdown pass against Purdue, missed the last six games.
Most Penn State players who are draft-eligible will hold their announcements until after the Rose Bowl. That includes Scruggs, Strange and Wallace. Others, like kicker Jake Pinegar are eligible to return for a sixth season and will save their announcements as well.
""My mom, she’s as excited as anyone. She’s more excited than me to go to the Rose Bowl,"" Scruggs said. ""... It’s the best bowl that you can have that’s not in the playoff.""
Mustipher called the Rose Bowl a game in which everyone in college football wants to play. He added that a win over No. 8 Utah could springboard Penn State into the 2023 spotlight.
""It’s not the same as any bowl,"" Mustipher said. ""They call it the granddaddy of them all for a reason. We’re going to find out why they call it that.""
Kickoff for the Jan. 2 Rose Bowl between Penn State and Utah is scheduled for 5:10 p.m. EST on ESPN.

https://www.si.com/college/pennstate/football/penn-state-football-beaver-stadium-renovation-plan,Penn State Is 'Very Close' on Beaver Stadium Renovation Plan,"'I want to make this building better,' Penn State Athletic Director Patrick Kraft says.
Penn State Athletic Director Patrick said he's ""very close"" to recommending a Beaver Stadium renovation plan to President Neeli Bendapudi and the Board of Trustees, likely meaning that the university will not build a new stadium.
Speaking at a bowl media event Friday from Beaver Stadium, Kraft said the athletic department has conducted 19 studies over the past decade regarding the stadium's future. Those studies have assessed whether Penn State should renovate Beaver Stadium or build a new venue.
Kraft mentioned renovations several times Friday, citing that as the most likely direction toward modernizing the nation's second-largest stadium. He also called it a ""huge project.""
""I make no bones about it: I love this building,"" Kraft said. ""I love coming in this building, I love the history of this building. When I walk the parking lots and I talk to people about having generations of memories in the building, I want to make this building better, and we have to do that.
""We’re very close. All the data is there. Now it’s figuring out the financial models, how it would work, what’s the recommendation. So we’re close.""
Beaver Stadium's future has been a prominent Penn State discussion since 2017, when the athletic department unveiled its 20-year facilities master plan. Earlier this year, Penn State surveyed season-ticket holders and other groups for their views on Beaver Stadium's future. The survey included questions about club suites and other high-end amenities and took the fan temperature regarding renovation or new construction.  
The original master plan included a Beaver Stadium renovation proposal designed to modernize the facility while maintaining capacity of at least 100,000. Beaver Stadium has been in its current location since 1960 and has been expanded seven times, most recently in 2001, to its current capacity of 106,572.  
Kraft called that 100,000 number important, since venues of that size are rare. Penn State was successful filling Beaver Stadium this season, recording its highest average attendance since 2008. Kraft said the program sold nearly 92,000 season tickets for the season.
Kraft added that ""no one is building a 100,000-seat stadium"" because of costs. Northwestern recently announced plans to build a 35,000-seat stadium to replace Ryan Field for an estimated $800 million. Northwestern said the stadium will be privately funded, in part through a $480 million gift from the Ryan family.
""To build new anywhere it’s expensive, let me put it that way,"" Kraft said. ""No one is building a 100,000-seat stadium. That's important to us. I think that's an important piece of who we are. So yes, there is a financial threshold that building new just would be unfeasible.""
What will be feasible, Kraft assured, is Beaver Stadium's ability to host a future College Football Playoff game. The venue undergoes annual winterization after the regular season, which makes December events difficult to hold. However, Kraft said that would not deter the program from hosting a home playoff game in the first round.
""Make no bones about it: If we were to play a playoff game in three weeks, we would play a playoff game in here,"" Kraft said. ""I don't care what it would take. We would go flush the toilets and keep the water running for a month before. We're going to play a football game in here.
""... I also think the work that would be done on Beaver Stadium allows us to use it more throughout the year as well. I think it's not just solely football, but we've got to also find ways to help enhance the building and keep the life of the building. Our team is really working on how we can maximize Beaver Stadium more than seven days. So all of those things would play into any sort of renovation.""
