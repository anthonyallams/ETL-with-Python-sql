Here are three takeaways from the historic victory:
TIMME TIME
Photo by Myk Crawford
Upon witnessing Drew Timme, Gonzaga's 6-foot-10 center, pull off a gather-step on a coast-to-coast fastbreak before throwing down a one-hand dunk, Dan Dickau asked rhetorically if there was another player in college basketball better than the Zags' two-time All-American.
If Tuesday’s 32-point, 10-rebound performance wasn’t convincing enough, then maybe the last two weeks of work is — over the last five games, he’s averaged 27.6 points and 10 rebounds per game on 69.3% shooting from the floor.
The back-to-back West Coast Conference player of the week came up big in two crucial runs that helped the Zags put the Grizzlies away for good.
Down 10, Timme rattled off eight points to kick off a 26-8 run, including two scores to conclude the run and give Gonzaga a sizable lead heading into the half.
Timme remained aggressive coming out of the locker room to help build a 17-point lead midway through the second half. His emphatic slam was his third basket in an 11-4 run.
After missing two free throws late against Alabama, which put him at 29 points to end the night, Timme knocked down his last four shots from the charity stripe to go over the 30-point benchmark for the first time this season.
BANNAN HELD IN CHECK
Photo by Myk Crawford
Gonzaga’s defense has struggled at times this season, especially when it comes to containing the other teams' primary scorer. Alabama's Brandon Miller dropped 36 points on the Zags over the weekend, and  Northern Illinois guard Keshawn Williams (27 points), Purdue center Zach Edey (23 points) and Texas guard Tyrese Hunter (26 points) all had their way against the Bulldogs' 42nd-ranked defense.
Facing Josh Bannan, who led Montana in eight different statistical categories heading into Tuesday, the Zags kept the 6-foot-10 forward in check.
After two 3-pointers in the opening minutes, Bannan didn’t find the bottom of the basket until three minutes into the second half before finishing with a modest 19 points. Considering the redshirt junior was coming off 27-point and 22-point performances in his last two outings, he had a small impact for the majority of the ballgame.
WINNING THE TURNOVER BATTLE

Taking care of the ball has eluded the Zags at times this season — they averaged 14.5 giveaways through the first eight games after committing 18 such mistakes in a narrow loss to Baylor.
Since then, though, the starting backcourt has helped the offense become crisper. Nolan Hickman has posted his third consecutive game with no turnovers, while Rasir Bolton has committed just four over the previous five games. Though both guards were held to 10 combined points on Tuesday, Gonzaga outscored Montana by 23 points when they were on the floor.
Finishing with nine turnovers as a team, the Zags have averaged 8.8 turnovers in their last five games.

Drew Timme led the way with a season-high 32 points and grabbed 10 rebounds while Julian Strawther pitched in 15 points and 10 boards to lead the Zags (10-3), who scored a combined 34 points off turnovers and second-chance points.
Gonzaga trailed by double-digits after a hot start shooting the ball from Josh Bannon and the Grizzlies (6-6). The junior, who came into the night shooting 55% from deep, knocked down his two 3-pointers at the midway point of the first half and headed to the locker room with 8 points, as did redshirt junior Lonnell Martin.
Bannan finished the night with 19 points on 8-for-12 shooting from the field.
Out of a timeout down 10, the Zags flipped the script with a 26-8 run to close out the first half. Timme led the way with 18 points and eight rebounds to help build a 36-28 advantage over the Grizzlies, who missed nine of their last 10 shots heading into the locker room.
Timme continued to find the bottom of the basket in the second half, including a one-man fastbreak that saw the 6-foot-11 center blow by a Montana defender to throw down a thunderous dunk to give Gonzaga a 17-point advantage.
Dischon Thomas didn’t let Montana go down easily, though. The redshirt junior scored 15 second-half points to keep his squad within striking distance down the stretch. 
Brandon Whitney capped off a 13-4 run that put the Grizzlies down just five with under five minutes remaining. 
From there, the Zags' defense gave up just six points in the final three minutes to hold on for the victory.

The No. 11 Gonzaga Bulldogs are on the verge of history and will have a chance to set a new modern record for the nation's longest home win streak Tuesday (December 20) against Montana.  
You can stream this game live on FuboTV (Start your free trial).
Gonzaga (9-3) improved to No. 11 in the latest AP poll following wins over Northern Illinois and No. 9 Alabama last week. 
Alabama was ranked No. 4 until they were upset by the Zags in the C.M. Newton Classic on Saturday. Drew Timme continued to shine in that game, leading Gonzaga with 29 points and 10 rebounds, and helping the Bulldogs pick up their fourth win in a row. 
It was the Bulldogs' biggest win of the season since beating then-ranked No. 4 Kentucky on November 20. 
Against NIU earlier in the week, Gonzaga secured its 71st consecutive victory at the McCarthey Athletic Center, which ties the Bulldogs with Arizona for the most in the modern era of Division 1 (Since 1985), which the Wildcats accomplished from 1987-1992. 
With a win over Montana Tuesday, Gonzaga would set a new record for the longest home win streak in the modern era of Division 1 men's basketball with 72 straight wins on its home court.  
Montana (6-5) and Gonzaga have plenty of history against each other. The two have been playing each other since the 1915-1916 season, and Tuesday's game will mark the 153rd meeting between the programs. The Grizzlies hold an 88-65 advantage in the series all-time, but Gonzaga has won the last 10 times these two teams have met. 
A win for Gonzaga would not only make history for the program, but it would also be a historic night for Timme, who would notch his 100th victory as a Bulldog. The senior All-American currently boasts a career record of 99-10.

The Zags (9-3) will host Montana (6-5) on Tuesday at 6 p.m. before getting a seven-day break, which ends on Dec. 28 when Gonzaga welcomes Eastern Oregon.
Ranked No. 11 in the country, the Zags are riding a four-game winning streak after Saturday’s victory over Alabama in Birmingham. 
Forward Drew Timme was the Zags' leading-scorer in all four games, averaging 26.5 points on 64.5% shooting from the field in that span.
Montana also enters Tuesday’s matchup coming off a string of consecutive wins — three to be exact — and like Gonzaga, much of their offensive production comes from a big man.
Junior forward Josh Bannan sits atop the Grizzlies in eight statistical categories, including his per-game averages in points (15.4), rebounds (9.1) and assists (3.2). He's also shooting a team-high 55% from 3-point range on 20 attempts.
The 6-foot-10 Melbourne, Australia native scored 22 points on 8-of-10 shooting from the field in Montana’s most recent win over Prairie View A&M on Saturday. 
The Grizzlies’ starters registered all 81 points against the Panthers, with redshirt senior guard Aanen Moody being the team’s second-highest scorer with 21 points.
Montana shot 57.9% from the 3-point range while holding Prairie View A&M to 30.0% from the same distance. 
“We feel that if we’re physical and aggressive, we can keep our opponents’ field-goal percentage low, and the best way for us to shoot at a high percentage is to get the right shot for the right guy in the right places,” said Montana head coach Travis DeCuire on the Gonzaga Nation podcast. 
The last time the Zags and Grizzlies faced off was Dec. 8, 2015, when Gonzaga narrowly avoided an upset in a 61-58 win. 
“We were in a really good spot to close the game, but we made some mistakes… and let that one get away,” DeCuire said. “Hopefully we’ll find ourselves close down the stretch again.”
Although Montana has an 0-9 all-time record against Gonzaga, DeCuire doesn’t want his players to approach the matchup differently from any other game. 
“I try to treat every game the same,” DeCuire said. “You don't want your team to be too high or too low. You don’t want to approach a non-D-1 game with less energy than you would an opportunity to play a top-20 program — anxiety comes into play sometimes when you do that.” 
After playing Gonzaga, the Grizzlies will open conference play in the Big Sky against Eastern Washington on Dec. 29 and Idaho on Dec. 31. Both games are at home. 
The Zags’ first West Coast Conference opponent is Pepperdine on Dec. 31 at the McCarthey Athletic Center. ",Gonzaga Nation,"Montana, Gonzaga men's basketball, Drew timme, Josh bannan, Gonzaga bulldogs, Basketball, Montana grizzlies, Aanen moody",Henry krueger,"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 17:55:06 GMT","While most Gonzaga students have spent the past several days at home for their holiday break, the men’s basketball team remains in Spokane for one last game before getting a much-shorter time off.&nbsp; The Zags (9-3) will host Montana (6-5) on Tuesday at 6 p.m. before getting a seven-day break, ...",https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MzM4MTUxNjYwOTg3OTA5/gonzaga-bulldogs-washington-huskies55.jpg

View the original article to see embedded media.

The Gonzaga women’s basketball team moved up one spot to No. 22 in the latest Associated Press Top 25 poll released Monday.
The Zags (10-2) earned 14 more points in the poll (114) after defeating BYU (4-7) 67-58 on Saturday at the McCarthey Athletic Center. 
It was a hard-fought victory for the Zags, who were without starting guard Kayleigh Truong (foot) and backup forward Maud Huijbens (concussion). 
In her twin sister’s absence, Kaylynne Truong led the way for Gonzaga with 24 points on 8-of-16 shooting from the field. She also added a team-high four assists and three steals in 37 minutes. 
The win helped maintain the Zags’ national ranking, which they’ve held onto for four-straight weeks. In Monday’s top 25, Gonzaga is positioned behind Creighton (8-2) and ahead of Oklahoma (9-1). 
Defending NCAA champion South Carolina (11-0) remains the top-ranked team after picking up all 28 first-place votes. The Gamecocks are followed by Stanford (11-1), Ohio State (11-0), Indiana (11-0) and Notre Dame (9-1).
Gonzaga returns to action on Monday when they host San Diego (6-6) at 6 p.m.

The jump comes after a win over Northern Illinois last Monday followed by an upset victory over Alabama in Birmingham on Saturday, which marked the second victory over Quad 1 and top-25 opponent of the season. 
Drew Timme has been instrumental to the Zags' four-game winning streak, averaging 26.5 points and 10 rebounds while shooting 64.5% from the field in that span.
The Purdue Boilermakers held onto the top spot after receiving 40 of 60 possible votes to remain the No. 1 team in consecutive weeks. Right on their tail are the UConn Huskies, who earned their highest ranking since 2009 by claiming the No. 2 spot with Virginia’s loss to Houston on Saturday.
The Cougars are back in the top three following their win over the Cavaliers, while No. 4 Kansas and No. 5 Arizona round out the top five. The Jayhawks routed Indiana at home before the Wildcats held off Tennessee at home.
Two victories to kick off Big Ten play pushed the Wisconsin Badgers up five spots to No. 17 this week.
No. 19 Kentucky suffered the biggest drop this week after its third loss of the season — a 10-point loss to UCLA in the CBS Sports Classic at Madison Square Garden. The Wildcats are just 1-3 at Rupp Arena this season.
Entering the top 25 for the first time was No. 24 Marquette and No. 25 Arizona State, both of which knocked off Creighton last week to enter the rankings.
Maryland and Ohio State were unranked this week. The Terrapins lost to the Bruins, while the Buckeyes dropped a home game to North Carolina.
