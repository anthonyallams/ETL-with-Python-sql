https://www.si.com/nfl/chiefs/gm-report/kc-chiefs-are-ready-to-take-on-a-former-afc-west-rival-seattle-seahawks,Chiefs Are Ready to Take on a Former AFC West Rival,"The Chiefs have played in some memorable games against the Seahawks over the years, and a Christmas Eve battle could add to their storied history.
The Kansas City Chiefs will host the Seattle Seahawks in an inter-conference matchup on Saturday afternoon at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium. The two teams have an interesting history that dates back to when both clubs resided in the AFC West. The Chiefs lead the all-time series with a 33-19 record, but they lost in the last meet-up back in 2018. In fact, the Seahawks are one of only two teams Patrick Mahomes hasn’t defeated yet in his career. 
Prior to this Christmas Eve outing, let's take a look back at a couple of the most memorable matchups between Kansas City and Seattle.
On November 11, 1990, NFL Hall of Famer and Chiefs great Derrick Thomas sacked Seahawks quarterback Dave Krieg seven times in the same game to set an NFL record that still stands to this day. Thomas had many impressive games in his illustrious career, but this one topped them all. After the game, which the Seahawks won 17-16, Thomas said the one that got away was going to be the play he remembered most from that contest. 
With time running down, Thomas nearly had his eighth sack of the day but Krieg stumbled away, caught his balance and hit wide receiver Paul Skansi for a touchdown with mere seconds left. Despite the loss, it would remain one of Thomas’s most memorable performances of his career and one that Chiefs fans still talk about more than three decades later. 
The Seahawks are used to a little bit of rain coming from Seattle, but this particular flood of epic proportions that surrounded Kansas City dominated the headlines. It was a prime-time matchup on Saturday, October 3rd, 1998 and over three inches of rain fell in a two-hour span just prior to kickoff and all the way through the end of the first half. A total of over 6 inches of rain were reported around the Kansas City metro. 
There was also a lightning delay, with fans and players alike being instructed to take shelter midway through the second quarter. Officials actually shortened the halftime of this game to try and finish things at a decent hour. Rich Gannon led the way in the second half, having 12 completions on 19 attempts and tossing a touchdown pass to Andre Rison. The Chiefs would go on to win 17-6 in a game that fans and players will never forget. 
Could there be another weather phenomenon that takes over the storylines in Kansas City on Saturday? The wind chills are expected to be below zero and the high temperature is slated to top off at a relatively warm 20 degrees near the end of the game.
We know that Patrick Mahomes is a ""snow game guy,"" but is he a play-in-freezing-cold-weather-at-an-MVP-level type of guy? He’ll certainly be looking to make his case on Sunday as the current front-runner for the MVP award. Jalen Hurts, who had been the odds-on favorite to win recently, will not be playing for the Philadelphia Eagles this weekend due to a shoulder injury. Last week, Mahomes became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw the ball 40 times and complete 88% of his passes. It’s just another absurd thing the Pro Bowl quarterback added to his resume. 
The Seahawks have been hit-or-miss this season. Seattle has a better record than many expected, coming into the game at 7-7, and they are hoping to sneak into the NFC playoffs as a wild-card team. Quarterback Geno Smith has come back to earth lately but has shown he can be a starting-caliber player in the NFL. He will be without one of his favorite targets, though, as former Kansas State Wildcat Tyler Lockett will miss time with a broken finger. Smith will likely lean heavily on receiver DK Metcalf or one of his tight end outlets. 
The Chiefs will try to give the fans some relief after back-to-back close games against the Denver Broncos and Houston Texans. They’ll enter this week as a double-digit favorite, but there’s no guarantee that fans will get a breather. The offense will need to control the ball and not turn it over, and it would be nice to see the defensive momentum from overtime against the Texans roll over into this game. If the Chiefs can win the turnover battle, they will handle business. 
Though the weather outside will be frightful, a Chiefs win on Christmas Eve would be so delightful.","Sports Illustrated Kansas City Chiefs News, Analysis and More","Chiefs, Gm report, Afc west, Mahomes, Seattle seahawks, Patrick mahomes, Kansas city chiefs",Mark van sickle,"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 15:43:13 GMT","The Chiefs have played in some memorable games against the Seahawks over the years, and a Christmas Eve battle could add to their storied history.",https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NjQ5MTUxODUyNTIwNjEw/usatsi_11895211.jpg
https://www.si.com/nfl/chiefs/news/kc-chiefs-injury-report-updates-ahead-of-week-16-game-vs-seattle-seahawks,Chiefs Injury Updates Ahead of Game vs. Seahawks,"Kansas City's week of practice sheds some light on potential availability for Christmas Eve.
The Kansas City Chiefs are back at home this week for a Christmas Eve matchup on Saturday against the Seattle Seahawks, and their injury report has contained quite a few names in recent days.
To begin the week, four members of the team missed practice. The trio of defensive end Mike Danna and defensive tackles Chris Jones and Khalen Saunders were absent due to illnesses, with tight end Jody Fortson being out because of an elbow injury. Jones returned to practice on Wednesday, but the other three remained out and safety Deon Bush joined them with an illness of his own. The rest of the injury report — a group of seven players — were full participants on both days.
On Thursday afternoon, head coach Andy Reid took the podium to provide an updated look at the team's injury report situation in advance of Saturday's game. Additionally, he spoke about possible availability for wide receiver Mecole Hardman and tight end Blake Bell as they continue to work their way toward being officially activated off the injured reserve list.
In regards to Hardman, Reid indicated that he needs to check with vice president of sports medicine and performance Rick Burkholder before the team comes to a more defined decision. Hardman hasn't played since Nov. 6 due to an abdominal injury. Bell sustained a hip flexor injury during the preseason and has yet to log a single regular-season snap for Kansas City in 2022. Fortson missed practice once again on Thursday and was ruled out on Thursday afternoon, which would theoretically leave a spot open for Bell should the latter be fully healthy and in line to return against Seattle.
Saunders also missed practice on Thursday, leaving him doubtful for Saturday's game. Danna and Bush made their respective returns to work to round out the week of practice and are officially questionable for Week 16 as Kansas City looks to rise to 12-3 on the season.","Sports Illustrated Kansas City Chiefs News, Analysis and More","Injury report, Chiefs injuries, Kansas city chiefs injuries, Khalen saunders, Injury, Mike danna, Jody fortson, Deon bush, Kansas city chiefs injury report, Chiefs injured reserve, News, Kadarius toney, Kansas city chiefs injured reserve, Seattle seahawks, Mecole hardman, Chris jones, Chiefs injury report",Jordan foote,"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 19:17:11 GMT",Kansas City's week of practice sheds some light on potential availability for Christmas Eve.,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg1ODY4NDc3NzYyOTA1MjE3/usatsi_17071912_168390306_lowres.jpg
https://www.si.com/nfl/chiefs/gm-report/juju-smith-schuster-to-skyy-moore-where-kc-chiefs-wrs-fit-with-patrick-mahomes,Sorting and Solving the Chiefs' Wide Receiver Conundrum,"With all the Chiefs' wide receivers getting healthy for the end of the season and playoff run, how will playing time get divided among the group?
Nearing the end of the 2022 regular season, it's still not clear what the Kansas City Chiefs are doing with their wide receiver room. There have been injuries that caused a shuffling in the lineup and forced some players into larger roles, but as the group gets healthy and the playoffs approach, how will the wide receiver snap count and production be divvied up?
...Well, it's complicated.
JuJu Smith-Schuster is the only receiver on the Chiefs whose role is clear and obvious. Smith-Schuster has separated himself from the pack by becoming Patrick Mahomes's second-favorite target behind only Travis Kelce. He has been a reliable pass-catcher in the intermediate areas of the field, showing the ability to rack up yards after the catch, and he has had his number called in critical situations. He is quietly pacing to go over 1,000 receiving yards for the second time in his career. After Smith-Schuster, the pecking order gets fuzzy.
Marquez Valdes-Scantling was brought in as a free agent this offseason alongside Smith-Schuster and is second in receiving yards on the team. He only needs 59 yards in the next three weeks to surpass his previous career-high in receiving yards. The problem for Valdes-Scantling isn't his production; it is the level of consistency from play to play.
One play, Valdes-Scantling will make a nearly impossible catch, and the next, he will drop an easy ball. That lack of consistency has shown to be a drive-killer during parts of the season, and you can't help but wonder if that will come back to bite them in a crucial spot in the playoffs. Oddly enough, the most-used wide receiver since Week 10 has been neither Smith-Schuster nor Valdes-Scantling. That title belongs to Justin Watson.

Watson was a question mark even to make the roster before the season, and now he is getting the most snaps of any wide receiver on the team. It shouldn't make sense. He does certain things that benefit the Chiefs on offense; he's a vertical threat with his speed, a bigger-body presence as a blocker in the run game, and he has the trust of Mahomes and the coaching staff. However, he is statistically one of the worst wide receivers in the league in terms of production. For wide receivers with at least 20 targets this season, he ranks 111 out of 121 in yards per route run with 0.92. That puts him last on the Chiefs and more than half a yard below the league average. Watson is a solid player to have around as a depth piece, but playing the most snaps on the team in this stretch is perplexing.
Similar to how Watson's high usage is confusing, Skyy Moore's limited playing time is very puzzling. Moore was taken early in this past draft and expected to have a role on a team with basically all new pieces around Mahomes. However, that hasn't been the case, and the ""why?"" has gone unanswered.
Moore has shown his elite route-running, strong hands, and explosiveness when given the opportunity on the field. Mahomes has also shown to have trust in him in big spots. The only explanation that makes sense as to why Moore doesn't get more snaps is that it is just that it's taking longer than expected for him to adjust from a mid-level college program to the NFL, something we are not privy to by just looking at the film.
The final two pieces of the Chiefs' receiving room have missed significant time this season but are tracking to be healthy for the postseason. Mecole Hardman and Kadarius Toney play very similar roles for the Chiefs' offense, and it is one they have missed in their absence. Hardman and Toney are both dynamic athletes who are dangerous with the ball in their hands. Hardman has more trust and experience in the offense, as he has been in Kansas City since 2019. However, Toney is the better and more talented player when healthy. He brings everything Hardman can do but can be a true receiver downfield and is more physical after the catch. Toney's return may unlock a new level to this offense that we haven't seen yet this year. He is a weapon that defenses need to account for on every play because of his game-breaking talent.

If and when all the wide receivers are healthy, the snap count (from most to least) should culminate with Smith-Schuster, Toney, Valdes-Scantling, Hardman, Moore, and then Watson. Unfortunately, the Chiefs don't look at it the same way. If the recent weeks are any indicator, the three wide receivers who will get the most snaps in the postseason are Smith-Schuster, Hardman, and Watson. After that, Toney and Valdes-Scantling will play a rotational role and contribute to the offense. This leaves Moore as an odd man out, and unless the Chiefs coaching staff has something up their sleeves that they have been hiding, the expectations for Moore should be low for the rest of the season.
The Chiefs have had 14 games to sort through the wide receiver rotation. They have shown who they trust and prefer. Though fans may not agree with it, there is no indication that it'll change during the most critical part of the season.","Sports Illustrated Kansas City Chiefs News, Analysis and More","Kansas city chiefs wide receivers, Chiefs wide receivers, Chiefs offense, Gm report, Kansas city chiefs offense",Zack eisen,"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 15:09:27 GMT","With all the Chiefs' wide receivers getting healthy for the end of the season and playoff run, how will playing time get divided among the group?",https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NjEzMTY3ODExMjA4NzI4/usatsi_19040720_168390306_lowres.jpg
https://www.si.com/nfl/chiefs/news/seven-kansas-city-chiefs-get-selected-to-2023-nfl-pro-bowl-roster,Seven Chiefs Get Selected to 2023 Pro Bowl Games,"Several of Kansas City's best players have been invited to February's Pro Bowl Games.
The Kansas City Chiefs have been one of the NFL's best teams this season, largely thanks to the production of their standout players. Seven members of the team were selected as 2023 Pro Bowlers for early next year, with the Kansas City class being led by the duo of Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce. 
Joining Mahomes and Kelce in this season's group are center Creed Humphrey, left guard Joe Thuney, left tackle Orlando Brown Jr., defensive tackle Chris Jones and punter Tommy Townsend. Mahomes finished third among all AFC players in Pro Bowl fan votes (271,541), with Kelce occupying the No. 5 spot (248,279) and the trio of Humphrey (133,683), linebacker Nick Bolton (136,342) and running back Isiah Pacheco (117,314) all leading their respective units. The Chiefs finished fifth among all NFL clubs in this year's fan voting.
This is the fifth time in his five years as a starter that Mahomes has been voted in as a Pro Bowler, and Kelce is now holding that accolade for a whopping eighth season in a row. Brown is a four-time Pro Bowler now, as is Jones. 2023 will mark the first time that Humphrey, Thuney and Townsend make it. The fan vote carried a third of the weight for this year's decision on final rosters, with votes from coaches and players throughout the league being worth another third each. Despite their high fan vote totals, Bolton and Pacheco missed the cut. 
To say that February's Pro Bowl Games will be slightly different from prior versions of the Pro Bowl would be an understatement. Out is the traditional football game that was infamous for its missed tackles, and in its place will be a series of skill-based events and a flag football game to cap off the week's festivities. The NFL's Football Operations website provides a bit more detail:
The Pro Bowl Games presented by Verizon in Las Vegas in 2023 will be a week-long celebration of player skills, featuring a new format that spotlights flag football. The multi-day AFC vs. NFC competition will culminate in an action-packed flag game, featuring Pro Bowl players at Allegiant Stadium. The event will air on ESPN and ABC on Sunday, February 5, 2023.
The Chiefs, eyeing a trip to the Super Bowl, will be hoping that advancing deep into the postseason will cause their players to have to miss the Pro Bowl Games. If that isn't the case, however, the aforementioned group of seven will have the opportunity to participate in the first year of a revamped Pro Bowl week with plenty to see, do and experience.","Sports Illustrated Kansas City Chiefs News, Analysis and More","Chiefs pro bowl, Kansas city chiefs news, Chiefs news, News, Chris jones, 2023 nfl pro bowl, Tommy townsend, Patrick mahomes, Orlando brown jr., Joe thuney, Travis kelce, Chiefs pro bowlers, Creed humphrey",Jordan foote,"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 01:08:35 GMT",Several of Kansas City's best players have been invited to February's Pro Bowl Games.,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg2NzUwNTMxMTY5OTUzMjYz/usatsi_17517907.jpg
https://www.si.com/nfl/chiefs/gm-report/kansas-city-chiefs-week-15-snap-counts-vs-houston-texans-the-jerick-mckinnon-game,Chiefs Week 15 Snap Counts: The Jerick McKinnon Game,"Kansas City's snap shares from their Sunday win over the Texans were interesting on both sides.
In Week 15, the Kansas City Chiefs were facing off against a team with one win on the year. No one would've been able to tell judging by the game, though.
The Houston Texans went toe-to-toe with Kansas City on Sunday despite getting outgained by quite a bit on offense, forcing the Chiefs into a few mistakes and scoring opportunistic points throughout the afternoon. Both clubs needed overtime in order to settle on an outcome, with the Chiefs ultimately escaping with a one-score road win. It was a team effort through and through, as multiple players on both sides of the ball made their marks. 
Now that snap counts have been released, what jumped off the page? Let's take a look at three notable takeaways from another week of Chiefs football.
All season long, Jerick McKinnon has been the veteran presence in the Chiefs' running back room and has shared snaps with either Clyde Edwards-Helaire or Isiah Pacheco atop the team's depth chart. Against the Texans, the 30-year-old matched a 2022 season-best by playing in 62% of Kansas City's available offensive snaps. This is partially due to Pacheco fumbling in the first half and also missing a critical blitz pickup, paving the way for the more experienced and reliable McKinnon to see the field more often. To say that McKinnon had a solid game would be an understatement.
Recording a season-high 10 carries, McKinnon amassed 52 rushing yards and the game-winning touchdown run in overtime. Through the air, he was targeted eight times and made all eight receptions while contributing 70 yards and another touchdown. In his last three games, McKinnon has averaged 5.2 yards per rush while also hauling in 17 passes. Over that span, he has 316 scrimmage yards and five touchdowns. McKinnon came on strong late last season and into the playoffs for the Chiefs, and his star is shining extremely bright for Andy Reid's offense as the 2022 regular season winds down. 
Late in the week, Friday to be exact, defensive tackle Chris Jones missed practice due to an illness and was ruled questionable heading into Sunday's game. Despite that, most expected the designation to be merely precautionary, and that's exactly what it was. Jones got the start for Kansas City down in Houston, but he didn't log a single box score stat aside from his snap count and wasn't very productive when playing.
Logging 40 snaps, Jones saw the field a season-low 63% of the time. This matched the second week in a row in which he didn't hit the 70% threshold, which is something to watch considering he was at 85% or higher in all five games prior to Week 14. Part of this was probably just the Chiefs being cautious with a star player who wasn't fully healthy, although the importance of Jones to Steve Spagnuolo's defense is sky-high. Jones needs to be effective in order for things to work well elsewhere and for Kansas City's sake, the team will hope that this pseudo-pitch count doesn't last much longer. 
Speaking of important parts of the Spagnuolo's defense, defensive lineman Mike Danna has emerged as a legitimate standout in his role player capacity for Kansas City. The 2020 fifth-round pick is displaying some versatility along the defensive line, having the ability to serve as either a traditional defensive end with lower-end athleticism or a high-level, undersized athlete on the interior. Since his return from an injury on Nov. 6, Danna has 20 tackles (three for loss), six quarterback hits and three sacks in seven games. His production was on full display against the Texans in Week 15, too.
Playing 31 snaps, Danna was on the field for nearly half (49%) of the Chiefs' available defensive reps. That matched his percentage from Week 14 and is nearly on par with his season average of 53%. In addition to recording a quarterback hit in the game, Danna got pressure up the middle to wreck Houston's first offensive drive and then came up with a critical third-down stop on the following possession. Danna's ascension is one of the Chiefs' best storylines on defense this season, and that story continued to be written on Sunday.","Sports Illustrated Kansas City Chiefs News, Analysis and More","Chiefs snap counts, Mike danna, Isiah pacheco, Kansas city chiefs snap counts, Gm report, Chris jones, Jerick mckinnon, Houston texans",Jordan foote,"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 13:32:20 GMT",Kansas City's snap shares from their Sunday win over the Texans were interesting on both sides.,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NTM5MDE1MjAwOTA4OTEw/usatsi_19647837.jpg
https://www.si.com/nfl/chiefs/gm-report/afc-west-is-won-but-kansas-city-chiefs-have-bigger-plans,"AFC West Is Won, but Chiefs Have Bigger Plans","Winning the division is just a stepping stone along Kansas City's ideal journey in 2022-23.
The Kansas City Chiefs accomplished something major on Sunday afternoon when they defeated the Houston Texans on the road. With that win, Kansas City clinched the AFC West title for a whopping seventh year in a row. That matches the second-longest streak for a single team in NFL history, making for one heck of a feat.
Despite that, the team is hoping that winning the West isn't the best thing it does all season. The Chiefs have bigger benchmarks to strive for, and quarterback Patrick Mahomes hinted at those following Week 15's victory:
""We accomplished our first goal. So, our next goal is to try to establish home field advantage. It's not in our hands. We can do our best to be ready in case we get that opportunity, and then win the Super Bowl. We just kind of continue to get better and better.""
Per FiveThirtyEight, Kansas City has an 18% chance of winning the Super Bowl as of Monday morning. In regards to that elusive first-round bye, Andy Reid's team has a 39% chance of earning it and trails only the Buffalo Bills in the AFC (50% chance). If both teams win next week — independent of other matchups throughout the league — those percentages will be 54% in Buffalo's favor and 38% in Kansas City's. If the Chicago Bears upset Buffalo and Kansas City takes care of the Seattle Seahawks in Week 16, Patrick Mahomes and company suddenly have a 75% chance of snagging that No. 1 seed.
The Chiefs have some demons to exorcise, as they've already lost to the Bills and the Cincinnati Bengals this year. Those were one-score defeats that ultimately could've gone either way, however, so there isn't any reason to think they can't hang with the other two elite clubs in the conference. As things currently stand, Kansas City would be hosting Tyreek Hill and the Miami Dolphins in the opening weekend of the playoffs. There are multiple reasons to secure that first-round bye (health, general rest, more time to prepare), but perhaps the most important is simply letting the rest of the AFC beat each other up. That, in and of itself, is a massive advantage.
With remaining contests against the aforementioned Seahawks, then back-to-back games against the Denver Broncos and Las Vegas Raiders to close out the year, the Chiefs don't have a serious test left on their schedule. The Bills, on the other hand, play a 3-11 Chicago team but then have an outing in Cincinnati against a red-hot Bengals squad and then have to come back home to host a New England Patriots club that could be fighting for its playoff lives in the season's final week. Cincinnati, still alive in the hunt for the top seed in the AFC, plays New England, then Buffalo, then Baltimore to end its regular season.
Before their loss to the Bengals, the Chiefs were in control of their own destiny in regard to securing that first-round bye. They now need some help, but all it takes is one Bills loss to assist Kansas City in being able to watch from home for a weekend while the conference's other playoff squads go to battle in the wild-card round. That advantage is extremely valuable now that only one bye is handed out, and it increases a team's odds of reaching the Super Bowl. Extending the AFC West streak is nice, but the Chiefs' truly desired goals are still out in front of them.","Sports Illustrated Kansas City Chiefs News, Analysis and More","Afc playoff picture, Gm report, Nfl playoffs, Houston texans, Chiefs playoffs, Afc playoffs, Mahomes playoffs, Patrick mahomes playoffs, Kansas city chiefs playoffs, Afc west, Afc west offseason",Jordan foote,"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 15:16:35 GMT",Winning the division is just a stepping stone along Kansas City's ideal journey in 2022-23.,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NTM5MjE4MTM4MDQ3ODc1/usatsi_19647851.jpg
https://www.si.com/nfl/chiefs/gameday/kc-chiefs-andy-reid-backs-patrick-mahomes-as-nfl-mvp-following-overtime-win,Andy Reid Backs Patrick Mahomes as MVP Following Overtime Win,"Reid and owner Clark Hunt had high praise for their quarterback on Sunday afternoon.
The Kansas City Chiefs needed overtime to defeat the 1-12-1 Houston Texans on Sunday, and they also needed every last bit of production quarterback Patrick Mahomes could give them. 
Mahomes completed 36 of his 41 pass attempts down in Houston, recording a season-high plus-10.3 completion percentage over expectation and also completing a whopping 20 consecutive passes to end the game. Mahomes's 87.8% completion percentage marked his highest in a full game at any point in his career, falling just shy of a 10-for-11 outing back in 2019 that was a partial game. He was precise all afternoon against the Texans' defense, carving them up on a routine basis.
Turnovers by running back Isiah Pacheco and wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster made things more difficult on Mahomes, as did some less-than-stellar offensive line play. Despite all of that, though, the 2018-19 NFL MVP added to his already impressive case for this year's award. Head coach Andy Reid agrees, praising Mahomes for bouncing back from an off game and backing him as this season's most valuable player in the league.
""You saw Pat and what he did — he took care of business today,"" Reid said. ""He went back to work and worked on it. You're talking about a guy that if he's not the MVP of the league, I'm not sure what's wrong with it. He cleaned it up, he comes out and we have almost 500 yards of offense. That's a pretty spectacular day there. That's what he did, a great example of how you go back to the drawing board and make sure that you clean everything up.""
Entering Sunday's play, Mahomes led the league in passing yards and touchdowns, as well as QBR. A 336-yard, two-touchdown outing in Houston helps his case for the NFL's most prestigious individual award, as does a critical fourth-quarter touchdown run that gave the team the lead (before it was ultimately squandered). In a year filled with MVP-level moments from Mahomes, his entire game against the Texans was magical.
For the fourth time in five seasons as the Chiefs' starting quarterback, Mahomes has thrown at least 35 touchdown passes. He's just the fifth player in league history to do so, joining the quartet of Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, Peyton Manning and Drew Brees in some very elite company. Mahomes remains the same player he was years ago at his core, but he's still finding new wrinkles to add to his game. Chiefs Chairman and CEO Clark Hunt spoke about Mahomes after Week 15's win, calling him the best quarterback in football. 
""Well, I think you can see that he's maturing as a player,"" Hunt said. ""He came into the league as a remarkably mature young man, and the responsibility that he had coming right out of college was tremendous and he handled it well. His game has evolved as we've moved on in his career. Certainly, there were some question marks about the offense this year given the changes we had at the receiver position. I think he's showed that he is the best quarterback in the National Football League and he's been able to adapt his game to continue to win and put up very impressive numbers on a weekly basis.""
The question marks Hunt mentioned have now subsided as the season has progressed, and Kansas City is only getting healthier. Kadarius Toney returned to the lineup on Sunday, and it's likely that Mecole Hardman will follow suit in the near future. With an added dynamic of speed within the Chiefs' offense, it makes sense to expect Mahomes to keep putting up eye-popping stats down the stretch. If that happens, Reid and Hunt's assessments may be true in the eyes of MVP voters.","Sports Illustrated Kansas City Chiefs News, Analysis and More","Andy reid, Clark hunt, Houston texans, Game day, Chiefs offense, Patrick mahomes, Kansas city chiefs offense",Jordan foote,"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 00:03:43 GMT",Reid and owner Clark Hunt had high praise for their quarterback on Sunday afternoon.,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NTM3MTM1MDc4OTA5NTUw/usatsi_19646468.jpg

With Sunday's road win over the Houston Texans, the Kansas City Chiefs secured their 11th victory of the 2022 campaign and are in the playoffs for yet another year. Most importantly, though, Andy Reid's team has clinched an AFC West title for the seventh year in a row.
That seven-year streak matches the Los Angeles Rams of 1973-1979 as the second-longest in league history. Kansas City now trails only the Tom Brady-Bill Belichick era New England Patriots (11 years) on the all-time leaderboard. This level of dominance is far from common in the NFL, and it takes a lot of focus and determination to work in conjunction with elite talent in order for things to pan out. Reid tipped his cap to his team for another division championship after the game, also shifting focus to the future. 
""I told the guys that my hat goes off to them,"" Reid said. ""That was a way to fight through it. You set a certain level and then all of these new guys come in and they're going, ""Hey, man, we've got to win this thing."" There's additional pressure on that but just to get through it, you could see that was a positive thing and then you can sail from there. You've got that done, and now you just go do your thing and go play.""
This clinching win didn't come easy, as the Chiefs struggled to put the Texans away on Sunday afternoon and actually trailed heading into the fourth quarter. Behind some heroics from Patrick Mahomes and Jerick McKinnon, as well as a key defensive play by Frank Clark in overtime, they ended up doing just enough to get to 11-3 on the year. With three more games left in the regular season, Kansas City is very much still fighting for the top seed in the AFC. Team Chairman and CEO Clark Hunt pointed that out in his postgame address, also appreciating the job his executives and coaches have done. 
""We ended up clinching the division for the seventh year in a row — that's really quite an accomplishment,"" Hunt said. ""[That's] very hard to do in the National Football League, and it's a testament to the hard work of Andy, Brett (Veach) and their staffs for putting together a team that has a lot of players who are able to come out and get that done today. However, the team recognizes that we've just given ourselves an opportunity. The most important football is in front of us. We've got some important regular-season games over the next three weeks, and then the opportunity in the playoffs to hopefully get back to the Super Bowl.""
During the offseason, the rest of the AFC West made a concerted effort to catch up with — or possibly even overtake — the Chiefs. The Denver Broncos traded a generational haul for and have a massive contract extension to Russell Wilson because they thought they were a signal-caller away from being a contender. The Las Vegas Raiders were coming off a 10-win season and added one of the very best wide receivers in football while also spending to add on defense. The Los Angeles Chargers invested in their front seven to help the side of the ball opposite young star field general Justin Herbert. Through 15 weeks, those efforts turned out to be failed.
The best Los Angeles can do is make the playoffs as a wild-card team. Still below .500 on the year, Las Vegas is way on the outside looking in. Denver was eliminated from playoff contention when it lost to Kansas City. The proverbial top dog remains the leader of the pack, and that was the very first goal the Chiefs set out to accomplish at the beginning of the year. Mahomes admitted so after Week 15's win but like Hunt and Reid, he also knows that there's more left to secure down the road. 
""We start every single season and the first thing we get told when we first walk in is, ""Let's win the AFC West,'"" Mahomes said. ""That's our first goal, to come in and win the AFC West. We believe it's always a tough division and obviously, with the players they got in the offseason, it was tougher. We accomplished our first goal. Our next goal is to try and establish home-field advantage. It's not in our hands, but we can do our best to be ready in case we get that opportunity, and then win the Super Bowl.""","Sports Illustrated Kansas City Chiefs News, Analysis and More","Nfl playoffs, Afc playoff picture, Game day, Clark hunt, Andy reid, Afc playoffs, Patrick mahomes playoffs, Kansas city chiefs playoffs, Mahomes playoffs, Afc west, Chiefs playoffs, Houston texans, Patrick mahomes",Jordan foote,"Sun, 18 Dec 2022 22:56:39 GMT",Three pillars of the Chiefs organization spoke about the team clinching another division title.,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzODkzMzE4MTM5MTI3MjM1/usatsi_19475881.jpg

The Kansas City Chiefs came into their Week 15 game against the Houston Texans favored by two touchdowns, but Andy Reid's team didn't get that memo early on. After three quarters, it was the home team up by a score of 21-16 with plenty of momentum on their side. Following some back-and-forth in the final frame of regulation and a thrilling overtime stint, though, it was the Chiefs who came out on top by a final score of 30-24. With the win, Kansas City is now 11-3 on the season.
Here are four takeaways from Sunday's game.
For the seventh year in a row, the Chiefs have won the AFC West. This matches the Los Angeles Rams' famous streak back in the 1970s as one of the most impressive in NFL history. Patrick Mahomes has now been a division champion in every single year he's started for the team, and Andy Reid's dominance over his division is second to none compared to non-Patriots teams of this generation. The Chiefs have more work to do moving forward and their hunt for the No. 1 seed in the conference remains in play, but step one is winning the West. That box was officially checked on Sunday afternoon, and the Chiefs are playoff bound. 
With Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts having multiple turnovers against the Chicago Bears, the stage was set for Mahomes to continue to build his own case for this year's league MVP award at the exact same time. With a performance that saw him complete 36 of 41 passes for 336 yards and a pair of touchdowns, that's exactly what he did. Additionally, Mahomes's rushing touchdown in the fourth quarter contributed to propelling the team to overtime. There's no other player in the league who is more important to his club's success, and Mahomes showed why once again. The 2018-19 MVP winner is firmly entrenched in the tight race for award No. 2. 
For the ninth game in a row, the Chiefs committed a turnover. In over two decades as a head coach, that's the first time an Andy Reid-led team has accomplished that feat. Running back Isiah Pacheco's fumble and missed blitz pickup were rookie mistakes, Travis Kelce's unnecessary roughness call was an instance of a veteran committing a youthful error and despite multiple questionable penalties from Carl Cheffers' crew, Kansas City was far too undisciplined on both sides of the ball.
The Chiefs ended up paying the price for their mistakes, even if the team ultimately won. If they want to win in the playoffs, they can't shoot themselves in the foot so often. It amplifies the difficulty of their matchups, which won't fly against superior opponents in January or possibly February. 
Early in the season, the Chiefs' defense featured some brilliant moments from young players and plenty of reason to believe that some rough edges would be smoothed out over time. Instead, Steve Spagnuolo's unit continues to put up questionable performances each and every week. A combination of missed tackles, little pressure from the front four and the aforementioned penalties all contributed to this game being much closer than it needed to be.
The per-play and overall yardage stats aren't bad, though. The inability of Kansas City to dominate what is normally an anemic Texans offense is notable, too, but surrendering just 223 yards and also coming up with a game-saving play in overtime is worth praising. There's still more work to do for this group and while it may have progressed from last week's narrow win in Denver, there's still a ton of room for improvement.","Sports Illustrated Kansas City Chiefs News, Analysis and More","Chiefs playoffs, Harrison butker, Steve spagnuolo, Frank clark, Afc west, Nfl playoffs, Game day, Patrick mahomes, Houston texans, Afc playoffs, Patrick mahomes playoffs, Afc playoff picture, Kansas city chiefs playoffs, Mahomes playoffs",Jordan foote,"Sun, 18 Dec 2022 21:24:32 GMT",Here are four takeaways from the Chiefs' Week 15 road matchup against the Texans,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NTM3MTMwNTE1NTA2Nzk4/usatsi_19646438.jpg

The Kansas City Chiefs' Week 15 matchup against the Houston Texans may not be a high-profile game, but the rewards for the visiting team could be terrific.
With a win, regardless of what happens with the Los Angeles Chargers in the late-afternoon slate, Andy Reid's squad will have won the AFC West for a league-leading (among active streaks) seventh time in a row. Additionally, a win would help Kansas City keep pace in the record column with the Buffalo Bills in the conference standings. This week's outing remains an important one for the Chiefs, even if it's against a struggling team.
Speaking of that struggling group, the Houston Texans enter their 14th game of the season with just one victory and a tie on the year. Lovie Smith's team has a league-high 11 losses in 2022 and is poised to secure a premier — possibly the premier — draft slot for next April. Despite that, the hosts still have plenty of grit and will be trying to play the spoiler role on Sunday afternoon.
With that in mind, ahead of their game on the road, the Chiefs' list of inactive players has been released:
The Chiefs opened the 21-day practice window for wide receiver Mecole Hardman this week, although Reid said on Friday that he was leaning away from officially activating the fourth-year man for this week's game. Hardman, who didn't appear on the injury report this week due to not being on the 53-man roster, will get at least one more week of practice under his belt before returning to in-game action. Defensive tackle Chris Jones missed Friday's practice with an illness, but he's good to go for Kansas City on Sunday.
Returning to the lineup is wideout Kadarius Toney, who re-aggravated his early-season hamstring injury back in Week 11 against the Los Angeles Chargers and has missed the last three games for the Chiefs. The dynamic second-year player brings a speed element to Kansas City's offense and could help bring its red zone proficiency closer to where it was at the beginning of the year. Even if Toney is on a pitch count of sorts on Sunday, his presence must be accounted for.
The Texans' inactives have also been released:
In advance of Sunday's game, Houston ruled out a multitude of notable players. Among those missing Week 15 are standout rookie running back Dameon Pierce, wide receivers Nico Collins and Brandin Cooks, cornerbacks Steven Nelson and Derek Stingley Jr., guard Kenyon Green and others. The Texans already faced quite the uphill battle in order to upset the Chiefs, and this week's challenge becomes even greater with all of these injuries factored in.","Sports Illustrated Kansas City Chiefs News, Analysis and More","Kansas city chiefs inactives, Game day, Chiefs injury report, Chiefs injuries, Chiefs injured reserve, Kansas city chiefs injury report, Mecole hardman, Kansas city chiefs injuries, Chiefs inactives, Kansas city chiefs injured reserve, Houston texans",Jordan foote,"Sun, 18 Dec 2022 16:38:17 GMT",Kansas City and Houston have announced their lists of inactive players for Week 15.,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NTMzNDgzNTUxNDAxNTgy/usatsi_19464913.jpg
