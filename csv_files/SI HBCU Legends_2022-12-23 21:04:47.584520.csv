Texas Southern Tigers were down two starters in the final stretch but went on to defeat the Hampton Pirates 82-77 in the Chris Paul HBCU Challenge finale.

Kehlin Farooq, the redshirt sophomore who transferred from Hampton, led all scorers with 19 points and eight rebounds against his former team. Joirdon Karl Nicholas added 17 points and five rebounds, and John Walker III and Davon Barnes scored 12 and 11 points, respectively.
Hampton had four players reach double figures, led by Jordan Nesbitt's 18 points and seven rebounds. Russell Dean and Daniel Banister scored 16 and 14 points, respectively, and Najee Thomas had a game-high ten rebounds to go with seven points.
Both teams had a solid offensive first half. For Texas Southern, a lot of the offense came from the interior, outscoring Hampton 24-10 in the paint. Most of the scoring came from Nicholas and Walker, who combined for 20 of the Tiger's 37 points. Texas Southern also won the early turnover battle 5-1. 
For Hampton, the first-half scoring came from the perimeter, shooting 5-for-11 from 3-point range. Marquis Godwin, who finished the game with 13 points, was responsible for two of those, pacing the Pirates with 10 points. Banister made the other three 3-pointers and ended the first half with nine points. 
The score was tied at 37 going into halftime.
The second half opened with a pair of runs, with Hampton scoring five in a row to take a five-point lead, then Texas Southern went on a 6-0 run to take a one-point lead. Neither team managed to create much separation as both offenses went cold the first 10 minutes after halftime (teams combined for 27%), but Texas Southern went on another 7-0 run, including the first 3-pointer of the half for either team from the Farooq.
It looked promising for the Tigers to gain control, but Nicholas, trying to get a steal on a fastbreak, was called for his fifth foul. 
Not even a minute later, Walker got called for his fifth foul on a 3-point play by Hampton's Raymond Bethea Jr., meaning head coach Johnny Jones had to manage without two of his starters with about seven minutes left in the game.
Farooq, however, took over down the stretch, scoring 17 of his game-high 19 points on a perfect 7-for-7 from the field, including 3-for-3 from downtown. From then on, the Tigers would hold the lead for the final 3:49.
The teams were evenly matched, but the two places Texas Southern had the advantage were turnovers and points in the paint. The Tigers scored 15 points off of Hampton's 13 turnovers (The Tigers only had five), and Texas Southern nearly doubled the Pirates' points inside, outscoring them 48-26.
With the win, Texas Southern moves to 3-8. The Tigers have one more game before Christmas, a road game against the Wichita State Shockers on Thursday at 7 PM CT.
The loss puts Hampton at 3-9 on the season and 0-4 in the Chris Paul HBCU Challenge. The Pirates' next game will end 2022 with two games in three days, first against the College of Charleston on Dec. 29 and the against UNC-Wilmington on New Year's Eve. Hampton will open in 2023 at home against Hofstra.

Travis indicated that he would take time, weigh the options, and make the best decision with his family.

Shedeur Sanders connected with Hunter for five receptions for 47 receiving yards and two touchdowns. His final touchdown came with 2 seconds on the clock to help force the game into overtime.
Hunter is a triple threat on offense, defense, and special teams. New Tigers head coach T.C. Taylor will have plenty of openings to fill as several of Hunter's teammates also will enter the transfer portal.

Let's take a look at James ""The Problem"" Houston IV sacks:
Houston is maturing into becoming an edge rusher for the Lions and making the most of his opportunity.  He's doing what many NFL teams need — someone to effect, harass, and get to the quarterback.
The next phase in his maturation process is to become an ""every-down"" defender.  
It will be up to Houston and the Detroit staff to cultivate the potential of what HBCU teams knew about him in 2021.

Davius Richard led the charge for the Eagles’ offense (10-2) with over 300 yards of total offense and two touchdowns. Richard and running back Latrell Collier combined for 173 rush yards on 37 carries. NCCU’s top-20 FCS ground attack gashed the JSU defense for 254 rushing yards and three scores from 42 total carries.  
The Tigers’ defense came into the matchup as the FCS’ best unit and surrendered season-highs in points, and 460 total yards. They didn’t force a single turnover for the first time this season and allowed over 400 yards of total offense in back-to-back games. 
Offensively, JSU didn’t have any problems moving the football through the air. In his final game with the program, Shedeur Sanders tossed for over 300 yards (329) and four scores, with two going to freshman phenom Travis Hunter. 
However, Sanders was sacked multiple times throughout the matchup. The Tigers’ offense rushed for a measly 64 yards on 23 carries as the Eagles’ defensive front stymied them. 
The game was ultimately decided by JSU’s final two offensive plays of their season. A play-action pass to backup tight end Hayden Hagler was dropped in the end-zone that could’ve pushed the Tigers’ to a double-overtime. Following that miscue, Sanders scurried from the rush to throw an incompletion on fourth-and-goal that cemented JSU’s fate.
The victory for NCCU gives them its first-ever Celebration Bowl title and its first HBCU Football National Championship since 2006. The Tigers complete the season with another missed opportunity at an outright HBCU title and an 0-2 record against the MEAC in the Coach Prime Era.

The 2022 HBCU football season concludes in Atlanta, Georgia, with the MEAC's North Carolina Central Eagles and the SWAC's Jackson State Tigers playing in the 2022 Cricket Wireless Celebration Bowl.
From an X's and O's standpoint, both teams sit atop their respective conferences in many statistical categories. Jackson State is ranked number one in total defense and offense, while North Carolina Central is ranked No. 1 in total offense and No. 2 in total defense.
Additionally, both teams have been equipped with great coaches and playmakers. They have received all-conference honors, with both coaches being tabbed as their conferences' Coach of the Year.
The game will be a great contest between two evenly-matched teams, and here is why each team could win and be named Celebration Bowl Champions.
North Carolina Central Eagles; Credit: Summer Washington
Right now, Jackson State is favored to win the Celebration Bowl. However, this North Carolina Central team, led by dual-threat quarterback and MEAC Offensive Player of the Year Davius Richard, is not a team to underestimate. Richard has completed 184 of 291 passes for 2,486 yards and 24 touchdowns to six of his targets that rank within the conference's top 20 receivers.
Richards is also a part of a premier backfield that features the MEAC's leading rusher Latrell Collier who has 881 yards and eight touchdowns on the season. In comparison, Richard sits right behind him with 691 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns.
The backfield is protected by a solid offensive line, including the MEAC Offensive Player of the year, Robert Mitchell. Mitchell has aided in the offense's productivity by having 62 pancake blocks and not allowing a sack in 659 snaps. Jackson State's front seven only allows the opposing team to have 100 yards rushing per game; however, Richard has proven he has a great arm and can be impactful on the ground.
If the offensive line can protect their quarterback and give him time in the pocket, create openings for their backfield and stop Jackson State's pass rush in addition to a slowing down Jackson State's productivity on offense then they will win.

If you've been covering Jackson State, you know a term used frequently is ""dominate,"" which is precisely what they've done this season. Aside from X's and O's, one of the most important things that will contribute to a Jackson State win will be how they deal with the 'Boulder' in the room. Today marks the final game of the Deion Sanders era at Jackson State before he officially took the coaching job at the University of Colorado.
From a football standpoint, Jackson State is a well-oiled machine with so many different moving parts that contribute to its success. One of the pivotal parts is their quarterback Shedeur Sanders who has thrown for 3,396 yards and 36 touchdowns.
Jackson State will have to come into this game believing that this game is just as important as any other and not underestimate the other team, especially the Eagle defense that has allowed only 19 touchdowns in the red zone and features FCS All-American Khalil Baker, who has 51 tackles (38 solo), four interceptions, five pass breakups, and a fumble recovery.
Additionally, as previously mentioned, the Eagles have a quarterback who is dual-threat and versatile with a backfield that features the MEAC's No. 1 pass rusher in Latrell Collier.
Jackson State's front seven, which features many first-team players, including Nyles Gaddy, will have to shut down his productivity early because everything starts with Richard.

Dec. 16, 2022; Deion Sanders at the 2022 Cricket Celebration Bowl Press Conference.
History is on the line for the Tigers, but Coach Prime doesn't feel there's pressure going into the contest.
""It's no pressure. This ain't pressure. This is fun.  This is a game,"" Sanders told reporters at the 2022 Cricket Celebration Bowl Coaches Press Conference.
In the 2021 Cricket Celebration Bowl, Deion Sanders viewed returning to Atlanta as a homecoming - since his days with the Atlanta Falcons.  How does he see the possibility of winning the 2022 HBCU National Championship in Atlanta?
""It's going to be fitting.  And, I'm thankful that God would choose the city for us to do so.""  Confident and ready for the challenge.
Last season, the underdog South Carolina State Bulldogs spoiled his return.  A superb defensive effort and surge in the second half destroyed the Tigers' magical ride in the 31-10 losing effort.  In the end, Coach Buddy Pough hoisted the Celebration Bowl Trophy and claimed the 2021 HBCU Football National Championship. 
Without excuses, Sanders knew it was a sound defeat.
""We were smelling ourselves last year,"" Sanders reflected.  ""So we were feeling ourselves.  I'm not going to say we needed to be humbled.  But we were feeling ourselves, and what happened was supposed to happen.  Not once have we mentioned anything of that nature in any meetings this year.  We don't result back and revert back to what transpired.  We are forward thinkers.  The mission was to dominate.  We dominated.  The mission was to win, and we won.  We have not completed the mission.  We have one more step to go.""
Today, Jackson State has a chance to shed last season's loss and stay true to its 2022 slogan - DOMINATE.  
Coach Prime and Jackson State have their minds on one thing alone: FINISHING.  
""We were going to finish what we started.  I can't tell a child to finish what he started, and I'm not. 
Sanders came back to finish.  What will that finish look like today?
