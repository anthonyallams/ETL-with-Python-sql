Right tackle Tristan Wirfs has been arguably the best draft pick of Tampa Bay Buccaneers general manager Jason Licht's tenure with the franchise. 
And in his third season, Wirfs has been announced on the Pro Bowl roster for the second-straight year.

""Over the past three seasons since Wirfs was drafted, the Buccaneers led the league in sacks allowed per pass attempt (3.1%),"" the Bucs said via press release. ""While also recording the most games without giving up a sack during that span (14).
""Wirfs becomes the third offensive lineman to receive multiple Pro Bowl selections while with Tampa Bay, joining Tony Mayberry (three) and Davin Joseph (two). He is the only one of the group to be selected multiple times in the player's first three career seasons.""
The Buccaneers also had four players named as alternates. 
Quarterback Tom Brady and safety Antoine Winfield Jr. are both first alternates while guard Shaq Mason, kicker Ryan Succop, nose tackle Vita Vea, and linebacker Devin White are others. 
Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts beat out Brady, as did Geno Smith of the Seattle Seahawks and Kirk Cousins of the Minnesota Vikings.

Quandre Diggs of the Seahawks is the lone free safety on the NFC Roster while strong safety Budda Baker of the Arizona Cardinals is the starter at his position, while Talanoa Hufanga of the San Francisco 49ers serves as the backup in the group. 
Seattle cornerback Tariq Woolen is the only rookie to land on the NFC roster this season, and New York Jets cornerback Sauce Gardner is the only rookie for the AFC.

https://www.si.com/nfl/buccaneers/news/report-rob-gronkowski-recently-contacted-buccaneers-about-potential-return,Report: Rob Gronkowski Recently Contacted Buccaneers About Potential Return,"It seems as though there is mutual interest between Rob Gronkowski and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers regarding a return. But time is running out.
According to a report by Rick Stroud of the Tampa Bay Times, Rob Gronkowski contacted the Tampa Bay Buccaneers about a potential return to the team.
""The Bucs had several conversations with Gronkowski around Thanksgiving about him possibly reuniting with quarterback Tom Brady to help the struggling squad secure a playoff berth.""
READ MORE: Tom Brady Shares Why He's Still Playing Football
In the article, Stroud provides specific details of the communications that occured between Gronk and the Bucs.
""Gronkowski told the Bucs he had been working out. He and the club discussed several options, including signing the 33-year-old to the practice squad to give him a couple weeks to get back into football shape, although they were willing to add him to the active roster."" 
But then, the kicker. 
""In the end, Gronkowski decided to remain retired for now.""
Buccaneers head coach, Todd Bowles, confirmed that a conversation with Gronkowski did take place... but that's all he considered it to be, a conversation. 
“It was more of a conversation than anything else,” Bucs coach Todd Bowles said. “Usually, when you have to think about playing, you probably don’t want to play. When it’s just a discussion, I didn’t think much of it at the time.”
Despite their struggles on offense this season, the Buccanee are still clinging to their perch atop the NFC South. And with the defense playing playing at a high level, it really feels like Gronk's presence in the lineup could unleash another element that the team — and his former quarterback, Tom Brady — desperately need.

Which ultimately makes this report by Stroud a bit demoralizing for Bucs fans.
The timing. The player. Everything about the scenario feels like it would have been perfect. But it seems, at least for now, Rob Gronkowski will not be joining the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for their final push to reserve a spot in the postseason.

https://www.si.com/nfl/buccaneers/news/multiple-teams-reached-out-to-rob-gronkowski-in-aftermath-of-tweet,Multiple NFL teams reached out to Rob Gronkowski in aftermath of tweet,"Three simple words led to Gronkowski receiving inquiries about a potential comeback.
Rob Gronkowski will be a future Hall of Fame tight end after his career in the NFL at some point in the future. However, after stepping away from the game prior to the beginning of training camp over the summer, Gronkowski has been focused on life outside of football.
That can lead to some intriguing miscommunications that garner national attention all at the cost of three simple words, 'I'm kinda bored.'
That was the tweet Gronkowski fired off on Wednesday evening. It would've been inconsequential if he wasn't such a polarizing figure around the league, and still a potential impact player on top of that.
Gronkowski reflected on the hilarity of the moment during an appearance on the 'Up & Adams Show' alongside host Kay Adams.
""Since the tweet, yes, two teams reached out. It was unbelievable,"" Gronkowski said. ""I don't say who but yes there was two teams. It was pretty nuts to me that everyone actually saw the tweet. It shows how far social media can go and how quick it can travel because I barely tweet actually. I just tweet once in a while but like, 'I'm kinda bored' you know, just people took that as I'm coming back to football right away.
It was just mind-blowing actually how my agent hit me up, two teams hit me up, it was just crazy,"" Gronkowski continued. ""My friends actually were hitting me up too, they're like 'bro are you really going back to football? I don't see that happening' I was like 'yeah man, you know I'm not.'""
While the longtime teammate of Tom Brady in New England and Tampa Bay didn't name the two franchises who reached out, it wouldn't be surprising if the Buccaneers were among the list of suitors. With that being said, maybe they're doing their research on Gronkowski a little more off the radar due to Brady's relationship with the veteran.
After all, Gronkowski has stated in the past that he would pick up the phone if Brady reached out to ask him to come back.
Tampa Bay could certainly use another difference-maker on offense to help turn its season around. Despite dealing with multiple injuries and missing five games, Gronkowski caught 55 passes for 802 yards and six touchdowns.
The four tight ends (Cameron Brate, Cade Otton, Ko Kieft, Kyle Rudolph) to see action for the Buccaneers this season have combined for just 66 catches, 631 yards and three touchdowns.

https://www.si.com/nfl/buccaneers/news/rob-gronkowskis-agent-updates-his-playing-status-following-cryptic-tweet,Rob Gronkowski's agent updates his playing status following cryptic tweet,"Gronkowski retired for the second time in his football career prior to the 2022 season.
Prior to the 2022 NFL season kicking off just a few months ago, gossip, rumors, and a variety of news-worthy narratives were surrounding the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Brady’s retirement. Marpet’s retirement. Arians stepping down. Bowles being hired. Brady’s marital status. Jensen’s injury. The list of storylines surrounding the Buccaneers coming into this season was longer than the number of weeks it's been since Mike Evans caught a touchdown.
Maybe the most interesting one of them all was the final saga of future Hall of Fame tight end, Rob Gronkowski. The veteran entered the offseason as a free agent and enjoyed his time away from the sport. Gronkowski eventually chose to announce his retirement for the second time in his career in June.
Since then, it's remained mostly quiet despite a lot of Buccaneers' fans hoping for a return. Well, until Wednesday night, when Gronkowski proclaimed on social media that he was bored.
In the aftermath, two teams reached out and Gronkowski's agent, Drew Rosenhaus, was forced to get involved.
According to AP's Rob Maaddi, Rosenhaus hasn't been informed that the 33-year-old has any plans to return to the playing field. 
That's a disappointing update for Tampa Bay, who is missing a safety valve like Gronkowski that star quarterback Tom Brady has utilized throughout his career in tough scenarios. In his final season with the Buccaneers, Gronk caught 55 passes for 802 yards and six touchdowns while being limited to 12 games due to various injuries.
Through 14 games in 2022, veterans, Cam Brate and Kyle Rudolph, as well as rookies, Cade Otton and Ko Kieft, have combined for just 66 catches, 631 yards and three touchdowns. 
When Brady elected to unretire over the offseason, it seemed destined that Gronkowski would return for one final run. For now, he appears content with life away from the sport.

https://www.si.com/nfl/buccaneers/news/bucs-projected-to-move-on-from-leonard-fournette-in-2023-nfl-mock-draft,Bucs Projected to Move on From Leonard Fournette in 2023 NFL Mock Draft,"The Buccaneers could move on from Leonard Fournette by taking one of the most dominant RBs in the draft.
Leonard Fournette's 2022 season has not gone as planned for the veteran back. The offense has sputtered since the departure of former head coach, Bruce Arians, and the Bucs' run game has taken a huge fall from grace after being one of the league's more dominant run games. Fournette was a huge piece of the Buccaneers' success on the ground since his arrival in Tampa Bay back when the franchise acquired him after becoming an outcast in Jacksonville in 2020.
Fournette really came onto the scene for the Bucs during the team's playoff run, where he earned the starting back role, which eventually led to the organization's 2nd ever Super Bowl win. This season, however, Lenny has found it difficult to find much running room posting just 568 yards on 159 carries and 3 touchdowns.
 READ MORE: Former Buccaneers' Wide Receiver Ends Brief Retirement
With the Bucs already looking more towards rookie Rachaad White, Lenny has seen few carries as of late and makes you wonder if his time in Tampa Bay is coming to end; and if it is, what are the Buccaneers' plan for the future at the running back position?
  CBS Sports’ Ryan Wilson, during his latest 2023 NFL mock draft, tried to answer that question as he has the Buccaneers selecting one of the most dominant running backs in college football.
""The Bucs could target a QB here, but with questions about Anthony Richardson's future and his uneven play this season, Tampa could look to fill other needs. RB isn't a huge priority with Rachaad White's emergence, but the team could move on from Fournette and plug in Robinson, who has been dominant for the Longhorns this season.""
Ryan Wilson has the Bucs selecting 19th overall in the first round of the 2023 draft, presumably assuming that they won't do much in the playoffs even if they make it. Pairing up two young running backs in White and Robinson would make for an exciting backfield. Robinson is perhaps college football's most versatile and NFL ready back after being highly touted coming out of the University of Texas.

The biggest concern with the Bucs going this route is what in the heck are Tom Brady's plans following this season. I am sure that Jason Licht has plans for whatever scenario plays out regarding Brady, but getting a running back of Robinson's caliber on a rookie contract is a steal and ultimately would look like an upgrade over Fournette. This move would be an enticing one for Brady as he will be looking for guarantees for the upcoming season on what any team will do to help bring both Brady and the franchise a Lombardi trophy.

https://www.si.com/nfl/buccaneers/news/why-is-tom-brady-still-playing-football,Tom Brady Shares Why He's Still Playing Football,"Tom Brady spoke about why he is still playing football on his weekly Let's Go! podcast.
Tom Brady and the Buccaneers' 2022 season hasn't quite gone to plan. The Bucs currently sit at just 6-8 and are fighting for their lives to stay atop the NFC South standings to make the playoffs. They have lost 2 of their last 3, including a comeback by the Bengals last week that saw the Bucs play their best half, then worst half of football this season.
The Bucs' season has been through a ton so far this season, including Brady going through challenging personal matters. During his Let's Go! podcast, Brady said it is not time to feel sorry for ourselves and expanded on why he still plays the game.
 READ MORE: Former Buccaneers' Wide Receiver Ends Brief Retirement
""It’s interesting because you would think, ‘Oh, well, why is he still playing?’ Because all you want to do is win, and that’s all sports should be about is winning. And I agree it should be about winning, but it’s also, I’m looking at it like, no, what am I learning? What am I learning from putting a similar amount of energy in over the last couple years and not winning? What is that teaching me?”
“You know, why should we feel like we’re just entitled to win all the time? We’re not. That’s not what life’s about.”
The Bucs and Brady found success early in the Brady era as they won a Super Bowl with Bruce Arians as their head coach in 2020. After several moves, this offseason, including Arians' retirement, the Bucs have had to deal with several obstacles. Even amidst all the obstacles, Brady knows that the team cannot start to feel sorry for themselves.
“I think anyone who’s gone through life and struggles at their job or struggles in other aspects of life, when you do put effort and energy into it, you know, what are you learning from that as opposed to, you know, why is that happening to you and for you?” the greatest quarterback of all time said. “You’re not a victim of that. We’re not a victim of losing games. The sun came up today. We’ve got something to do about it. We woke up, we have a chance. This is not the time to feel sorry for yourself. So get up, go into work and make it better, and improve it and work harder and work more determined.”

Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers do, in fact, have something to do about this season. At just 6-8, they are in trouble of giving up the 4th seed in the NFC playoffs. Luckily, the rest of the teams in the NFC South have their own troubles and all Tampa Bay will need to do is win their last two divisional games against the Falcons and Panthers to secure a sport in the playoffs. Things haven't looked pretty this year, but if the Bucs can take care of business Brady's and the Bucs' sunshine might start to glimmer a bit more on the other side of making the playoffs.

https://www.si.com/nfl/buccaneers/news/will-the-tampa-bay-buccaneers-make-the-playoffs,Will the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Make the Playoffs?,"In spite of everything, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are on a direct path towards the NFL Playoffs.
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers haven't scored 20 or more points in consecutive games since October 9th.
Even then, the Bucs still lost one of those games, a 41-31 shootout against the Kansas City Chiefs. 
Coming out of its Week 15 loss to the San Francisco 49ers, a 34-23 final stemming from a monumental second-half collapse, Tampa Bay has now surrendered more than 30 points in back-to-back weeks. 
Out of it all, the Buccaneers have a 6-8 record, and a 73 percent chance of making the playoffs. 
You read that right.

If quarterback Tom Brady and the Bucs can defeat Colt McCoy and the Arizona Cardinals on Christmas Day, then that number will climb to 81 percent before anything else in the NFC South factors in. 
But the division will play its part, as always. 
Lately, the rest of the NFC South has played the role of carrying Tampa Bay to the top of the division by continuously losing their own games, ensuring they don't threaten to take over the top spot in the NFL's worst division. 
 READ MORE: Former Buccaneers' Wide Receiver Ends Brief Retirement
This week, if the Carolina Panthers (vs. Detroit Lions), New Orleans Saints (at Cleveland Browns), and Atlanta Falcons (at Baltimore Ravens) all lose, then the Buccaneers' chances of earning a playoff spot climb above 90 percent. 
The same result happens if the Saints are the only other NFC South team to win their contest.
If Atlanta alone wins their game, Tampa Bay's chances move to 87 percent. 
And if Carolina is the only other NFC South winner, the Buccaneers' chances actually fall to 72 percent.

So, obviously, Bucs fans are also Lions fans this weekend. 
If Tampa Bay fails to take care of business in Arizona, and the Panthers beat Detroit, then those two get about as 50/50 as it comes with a matchup against each other coming the following week. 
But there's a scenario for the Buccaneers to clinch the NFC South next weekend with Carolina visits Raymond James Stadium. 
Of course, there's also a scenario where the Bucs are eliminated from playoff contention next weekend as well.

https://www.si.com/nfl/buccaneers/news/bengals-players-take-shots-at-tom-brady-after-beating-bucs,Bengals' Players Take Shots at Tom Brady After Beating Bucs,"A few Bengals' players had a message for Tom Brady after beating the Bucs 34-23.
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers were handed a tough loss by the Cincinnati Bengals this past Sunday as they lost 34-23. The score doesn't encapsulate how bad the actually was, however. The Bucs played perhaps their best half of the season in the first half as they went into halftime up 17-3 but completely folded over in the second half as they committed multiple turnovers and were flagged for numerous penalties that allowed the Bengals to easily get back into the game, ultimately resulting in their win in Raymond James.
Prior to the Bucs' horrific showing on Sunday evening, Brady spoke with reporters about Cincinnati's defense, which may have unsuspectingly given the Bengals some bulletin board material heading into the game. Per his Let's Go! podcast, Brady stated that the Bengals had a ""fairly tough defense"". It doesn't necessarily seem like Brady was intentionally taking a shot at the Bengals defense, but that's how the Bengals' defense took it, and boy did they run with it. 
Following their win over the Bucs in Tampa Bay, Bengals' Eli Apple and BJ Hill had a couple of messages for Tom Brady acknowledging that they didn't forget the quarterback's words prior to their matchup.
 READ MORE: Former Buccaneers' Wide Receiver Ends Brief Retirement
As the two were coming off the field following their win, Apple can be heard saying, ""the future is now, old man."", and shortly following Apple BJ Hill took it a step further making it known they didn't forget Brady's words prior to the matchup stating, ""we're fairly tough on defense, remember that.""
You never want to give the opposing team bulletin board material even if you didn't mean to. They will take it and use it as motivation to play their best against you and then rub it in your face afterward. Brady hasn't been one to give that type of material unless it is by mistake. This time he was on the wrong end and had to eat his words after the Bengals' defense was able to turn the Bucs and Brady over four times.

https://www.si.com/nfl/buccaneers/news/pat-mcafee-predicts-shocking-landing-spot-for-tom-brady,Pat McAfee Predicts Shocking Landing Spot for Tom Brady,"Media personality, Pat McAfee, floats a wild and surprising thought on where Tom Brady will be playing in 2023.
The future of Buccaneers' quarterback Tom Brady remains open to interpretation. Brady will become a free agent for just the second time in his career following the completion of the 2022 NFL season. The first go-around, Brady chose to continue his career in Tampa Bay. He won his seventh Super Bowl afterward, but after such a tumultuous season in 2022, Brady will once again find his options open and it doesn't seem likely he will return to the Bucs in 2023.
With that being said, it seems Brady will have one of two options at the head of his table: retire and jump into the broadcasting life or decide to continue his illustrious career by heading to another team come free agency.
The speculation regarding where Brady will end up next has brought up the GOAT taking his talents to San Francisco to play for his hometown 49ers or heading back to New England to rejoin forces with Bill Belichick and the Patriots.
READ MORE: Former Buccaneers' Wide Receiver Ends Brief Retirement
Former Colts' punter and current ESPN personality, Pat McAfee, looks outside of the majority and thinks that Brady could and will end up with the Las Vegas Raiders.
“Tom Brady’s about to be a free agent,” McAfee said on the Pat McAfee Show. “Tom Brady’s going to Las Vegas next year—is that what everybody’s just assuming? The dead cap for Derek Carr if he gets cut by the Las Vegas Raiders is $5 million. ... I think the writing is on the wall.”
At this point, the Raiders and the Bucs have had lackluster seasons after entering 2022 with highly anticipated goals. The Bucs and Raiders both sit at 6-8, but one is likely to make the playoffs while the other is not. Either way, going to Las Vegas would pair Brady up with longtime Pats' and current Raiders' coach, Josh McDaniels. With the Bucs' offense sputtering after the retirement of Bruce Arians, the relationship between Brady, Leftwich, and Todd Bowles may have reached its end.

https://www.si.com/nfl/buccaneers/news/todd-bowles-expects-veteran-buccaneers-offensive-lineman-to-return,Todd Bowles Expects Veteran Buccaneers Offensive Lineman to Return,"Bucs' head coach, Todd Bowles, spoke on his veteran's offensive lineman availability for the upcoming game vs. the Arizona Cardinals.
Tampa Bay Buccaneers' right tackle, Tristan Wirfs, went down with an injury late in the team's week 12 matchup against the Cleveland Browns. At first, the injury seemed devastating as Wirfs was rolled up on and caused many to believe that he suffered a season-ending knee injury.
However, it was more fortunate news for the Bucs as Wirfs' injury was confirmed as not being as serious as originally thought. Once evaluated, it was shown that Wirfs suffered a high ankle sprain - an injury that takes anywhere from 3-4 weeks to recover.
Since the injury, Wirfs hasn't seen any action in the Bucs' last three games: a win against the Saints followed by two consecutive losses to the 49ers and Bengals. Now, nearing the end of the injury recovery timeline, it appears that Wirfs could have a chance to return to the field this upcoming Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals.
 READ MORE: Former Buccaneers' Wide Receiver Ends Brief Retirement
Buccaneers' head coach, Todd Bowles, didn't give much into whether Wirfs will indeed play this weekend, but he does sound optimistic that given this week of practice to try and work his way back to playing shape, Wirfs could give it a go this weekend. In Wirfs stead, the Bucs' offensive line hasn't looked like a complete mess, but it hasn't been the most consistent. Wirfs is one of the highest-graded tackles in the league this season and has been since he entered the league. 
Getting Wirfs back would be a welcome sight for the Bucs as they only have three games remaining in the regular season - two of which come against NFC South opponents in order for them to claim the divisional playoff spot.
