Michigan State head football coach Mel Tucker met with the media on Wednesday to discuss the Spartans new additions to their roster on National Signing Day.
While the majority of that time was spent detailing the new crop of Spartans, Tucker was also asked about his coaching staff, which has come under scrutiny following a 5-7 season for Michigan State in 2022.
While a large faction of MSU's fanbases has expected changes to Tucker's staff this offseason, it sounds like they'll have to wait a little bit longer.
  ""I haven't planned to make any changes,"" Tucker said. “There's always opportunities for guys. I never wanna try to hold anyone back if they have an opportunity where they can better themselves, but I don't plan to make any changes at this time.”
Before Michigan State fans rush to their keyboards to spout their anger and disappointment over this statement by the head coach, there are a few things to consider here.
The Spartans had just wrapped up its 2023 class when Tucker was asked about potential changes to his coaching staff. While these high school prospects had signed their letters of intent, it's not all that uncommon for players to request releases from their LOI if their position coaches take new jobs post-signing day.
Michigan State was the beneficiary of that just last year, when four-star wide receiver Germie Bernard requested a release from his LOI from Washington after his position coach left for a new job. Bernard eventually signed with the Spartans, spent one season in East Lansing and then transferred to Washington.
The point is this — just because Tucker said ""I haven't planned on any changes"" does not mean that changes are not coming.
With that being said, my gut feeling is that both offensive coordinator Jay Johnson and defensive coordinator Scottie Hazelton will be back for the Spartans in 2023. Likewise, defensive line coach Marco Coleman, pass rush specialist Brandon Jordan and offensive line coach Chris Kapilovic aren't going anywhere, unless they are poached by opposing programs.
That leaves special teams coordinator Ross Els, secondary coach Harlon Barnett, tight ends coach Ted Gilmore, wide receivers coach Courtney Hawkins and running backs coach Effrem Reed.
In my opinion, the most likely coach to be replaced from that group would be Els, whose special teams units really struggled outside of the punting duties provided by consensus All-American Bryce Baringer.
Tucker coached the Spartans' cornerbacks this season, with mixed results. It's tough for a head coach to balance the responsibility of running an entire organizations with also coaching an individual position. I wouldn't be surprised to see Tucker coaching the corners once again in 2023, but its also possible that some reshuffling to the staff goes on to give Barnett more full-time help with the secondary.
With three months until the start of spring practice, there's still time for coaching changes to occur, but it doesn't sound like anything imminent is likely. ","Sports Illustrated Michigan State Spartans News, Analysis and More","Michigan state spartans, Michigan state football, Scottie hazelton, Ross els, Football, Mel tucker, Jay johnson",Matthew lounsberry,"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 20:21:25 GMT","After a 5-7 record in 2022, the won't sit well with the Spartans' fanbase...",https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NjUzNTA1NjA3NDQzNjE4/usatsi_19240122_168388427_lowres.jpg
https://www.si.com/college/michiganstate/football/michigan-state-spartans-football-recruiting-national-signing-day-2023-recap-mel-tucker-msu-122322,NSD Recap: Michigan State lands 2nd consecutive Top 25 class,"The Spartans added 26 players to their roster from the high school ranks and transfer portal...
Michigan State football had an eventful National Signing Day on Dec. 21, and the Spartans wrapped up a December full of ups and downs on the recruiting trail with a strong finish. 
MSU signed all 14 high school verbal commits that they had coming into the day, and added a 15th player to the class in the form of a four-star JUCO transfer at a position of need. That’s something to be proud of given the way the 2022 season went for the Spartans.
Michigan State’s 2023 class is currently ranked No. 25 nationally and fourth in the Big Ten by 247Sports team composite rankings. The Spartans have the third-highest average player rating in the conference, only behind Ohio State and Penn State. 
However, while the ‘23 class may exceed recruiting expectations from the Mark Dantonio era, it doesn’t quite meet the expectations that Mel Tucker himself brought to East Lansing when he was hired in 2020. Michigan State suffered eight decommitments during this cycle – five of which were four-star prospects – which kept this 2023 class from being inside the nation’s Top 15 and the best in school history.
However, programs that chase four-star talent are going to suffer recruiting losses. That comes with the territory. Tucker wants Michigan State to throw its hat in the ring for some of the best players in the country. The Spartans didn’t land any of the big, five-star fish that they pursued in the 2023 cycle, but they tied a program record with nine four-star signees.
Michigan State was also very active in the transfer portal this offseason and on Signing Day. The Spartans have added 11 players through the portal so far, including a couple guys who will make an instant impact. Combining the high school signees and the transfer additions, MSU has 26 new players headed to East Lansing for 2023.
With the class overview out of the way, what were some of the biggest individual recruiting wins for Michigan State on Signing Day?
The first was JUCO transfer offensive lineman Keyshawn Blackstock. Offensive line coach Chris Kapalovic has gone into the junior college ranks before, getting Brandon Baldwin in the 2021 class. Blackstock was one of the best lineman in JUCO last year, and is likely going to play right away. He became the 15th member of the class and the ninth four-star when he signed with the Spartans on Wednesday. This is a major win for MSU at a position of need.
The next big landing was Texas A&M transfer defensive lineman Tunmise Adeleye. An Under Armour All-American and highly-ranked four-star coming out of high school, the Spartans feel like they can unlock some of Adeleye’s untapped potential in East Lansing. After redshirting as a true freshman, Adeleye played in only three games for the Aggies in 2022, and recorded six tackles. He is currently ranked the No. 19 player in the transfer portal (via 247Sports) and has four years of eligibility remaining.
Michigan State also added USF transfer running back Jaren Mangham. Older brother of MSU safety Jaden Mangham, the elder Mangham had 128 all-purpose yards and three touchdowns last season. The Spartans added another former four-star defensive tackle in Dre Butler, who transferred from Liberty. MSU will be his third school, as he started his collegiate career at Auburn.
While Tucker and staff would prefer to build internally, the transfer portal is a necessity in this era of college sports. There is major upside in many of these players, with most of them having an opportunity to play next season. Expect a few more players to be added to the Spartans’ roster before February. 
Even after a 5-7 season and losing top recruits, the Spartans have a top 25 recruiting class. Tucker and the staff have started recruiting for 2024, already with two four-star commits. If Michigan State gets back on track on the football field, they could have an even better class next year on the recruiting trail.","Sports Illustrated Michigan State Spartans News, Analysis and More","Keyshawn blackstock, Mel tucker, Football, National signing day, Michigan state football recruiting, Michigan state spartans, Tunmise adeleye, 2023 recruiting class",Aedan mulcrone,"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 19:45:46 GMT",The Spartans added 26 players to their roster from the high school ranks and transfer portal...,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NjUzMjI4NTgxNzkwODgy/usatsi_18970657_168388427_lowres.jpg
https://www.si.com/college/michiganstate/basketball/michigan-state-spartans-basketball-five-takeaways-oakland-grizzlies-tom-izzo-msu-122122,"Five Takeaways: Michigan State shakes off slow start, routs Oakland in 2nd Half","The Spartans had to knock off a little rust, but overpowered the Grizzlies after halftime...
After nearly two weeks off, Michigan State men's basketball returned to action on Wednesday night against the Oakland Grizzlies. The Spartans showed a little rust during a first half, allowing Oakland to shoot 50 percent from the field through the opening 10 minutes.
However, Michigan State finished the half with an 8-0 run to take a 29-24 lead at the break. In the second half, the Spartans opened hot from outside and quickly stretched their lead to 20 points.
Michigan State got a little loose with the basketball down the stretch, but coasted to a 67-54 win to improve to 8-4 on the year.
1.) Sloppy start for MSU
Through much of the first half, Michigan State looked like a team that hadn't played in 11 days. The Spartans stuggled offensively against the multiple zone looks that Oakland head coach Greg Kampe through at them, most notably the 1-3-1 zone.
MSU had 11 turnovers in the first half, much to the frustration of head coach Tom Izzo. However, the Spartans came out of the locker room with a plan of attack. Michigan State was more effective in transition to start the second half, and bombarded the Grizzlies with the three-ball to bust the game open.
The Spartans had five turnovers in the second half, with several of those coming late with the game mostly in hand. Still, Izzo won't be pleased with 16 giveaways on the night.
2.) Jaden Akins looks healthy again
Izzo alluded to this on Monday during media availability, but sophomore guard Jaden Akins does look to be in better shape and healthier coming out of the 11-day layoff.
Akins scored 15 points and was an efficient 5-of-8 from the floor and 3-for-4 from three-point range. He added four rebounds tonight for the Spartans.
When healthy, Michigan State can play with anybody in the Big Ten and maybe the country. That will be the key for the Spartans as conference play approaches in 2023. Senior small forward Malik Hall is hopeful for MSU's home game against Buffalo on Dec. 30.
3.) Joey Hauser stays hot offensively
Like Michigan State as a whole, senior Joey Hauser looked sluggish and out of rhythm to start the game. However, Hauser settled in and ended up putting forth a strong performance for the Spartans.
Hauser led Michigan State with 16 points, and was red-hot from the floor (6-of-9) and from beyond the three-point line (4-of-5). The senior added four rebounds, four assists and a steal. As mentioned above, Hauser was a little out of wack at times tonight as well — he took a hard blow to the face in the first half while defending a dribble drive, which may have factored in — and finished with four turnovers.
4.) Tyson Walker, A.J. Hoggard were a bit off
Both Tyson Walker and A.J. Hoggard played alright tonight, but like Hauser they seemed to be a bit off. I think the layoff had something to do with that.
Walker shot just 1-for-7 in the first half, but he finished with 13 points on 5-of-13 shooting for the game and added three rebounds, three assists and a blocked shot. He was 3-for-8 from beyond the three-point line. Hoggard, meanwhile, went 3-for-7 from the field but 0-for-2 from deep on his way to eight points, four rebounds, eight assists, a block and a steal.
On a positive note, despite the 16 turnovers as a team, Walker and Hoggard just had one giveaway each. Izzo was happy about that following the game.
5.) Pierre Brooks sits 1st half, Spartans struggle from FT line
Sophomore wing Pierre Brooks did not play in the first half tonight for the Spartans, and head coach Tom Izzo said that was due to disciplinary reasons for tardiness. Brooks played 12 minutes in the second half, but didn't make much of an impact, missing the only shot he took and going 0-for-2 from the free throw line.
Brooks wasn't the only Spartan who struggled from the charity stripe, as Michigan State shot just 7-for-16 from the free throw line as a team tonight. That was a strikingly poor display from MSU, which had shot 77.6 percent on free throws coming into tonight's game.
Michigan State will play one final game in 2022 when they host Mid-American Conference opponent Buffalo against Dec. 30 to conclude non-conference play. The Spartans have gone 7-3 against one of the toughest out-of-conference slates in the country thus far, and will be the favorite against the Bulls as well.
The beginning of the New Year will bring the return of Big Ten play with it, and Michigan State will host Nebraska and Michigan in back-to-back games in the first week of January. The Spartans are 1-1 in league play thus far, with a home loss to Northwestern and a road win over Penn State.","Sports Illustrated Michigan State Spartans News, Analysis and More","Five takeaways, Aj hoggard, Oakland grizzlies, Tom izzo, Jaden akins, Tyson walker, Basketball, Joey hauser, Michigan state basketball, Pierre brooks",Matthew lounsberry,"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 02:31:42 GMT","The Spartans had to knock off a little rust, but overpowered the Grizzlies after halftime...",https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NjEzNDE5ODcyMTAxNTM4/usatsi_19666118_168388427_lowres.jpg

Michigan State signs No. 1-ranked defensive lineman from transfer portal,"The Spartans have beefed up along the line of scrimmage on National Signing Day...
On an eventful National Signing Day, Michigan State football has landed their top target in the transfer portal in former Texas A&M defensive lineman Tunmise Adeleye.
A member of the 2021 recruiting class, Adeleye was ranked No. 39 overall in the country and was the second-highest ranked prospect in what was a Top 10 class for the Aggies during that cycle.
Adeleye entered the transfer portal this offseason after redshirting in 2021 and being used sparingly by the Aggies a season ago. He was the No. 16 overall player in the transfer portal and the No. 1 defensive lineman, according to 247Sports' rankings.
Michigan State hosted Adeleye over the weekend of Dec. 9 and made a strong impression on the former Top 50 recruit. Pass rush specialist Brandon Jordan, who worked individually with Adeleye while the lineman was still in high school, led the charge for the Spartans during this recruitment.
Adeleye would later visit Miami and Cal following his trip to East Lansing, with the Hurricanes posing the biggest threat to the Spartans. Yet, with Jordan anchoring MSU's efforts, it was Michigan State who ultimately landed one of the biggest fish the transfer portal had to offer this offseason.
At 6-foot-4 and 290 pounds, Adeleye has rare athleticism that will make him a menace for opposing offensive lineman in the Big Ten. While he'll primary play defensive tackle for the Spartans, Adeleye has enough burst and get-off to be used on the edges as well.
Michigan State has placed a point of emphasis on strengthening their line of scrimmage on both sides of the football during this recruiting cycle. Out of the transfer portal, the Spartans have landed Adeleye, former Liberty defensive lineman Dre Butler and former Florida State defensive lineman Jarrett Jackson.
MSU also signed four-star EDGE rusher Bai Jobe and four-star defensive linemen Andrew Depaepe and Jalen Thompson from the high school ranks in their 2023 recruiting class.
On offense, the Spartans added junior college transfer O-lineman Keyshawn Blackstock, the No. 8 overall JUCO prospect in the country. While listed as an interior offensive lineman, Blackstock will compete for one of the starting offensive tackles positions for Michigan State. Additionally, MSU signed four-star offensive tackle Stanton Ramil — the program's highest-rated offensive lineman prospect since 2010 — as well as four-star IOL Cole Dellinger.
Football games are won at the line of scrimmage, and the pieced that Michigan State added today to their defensive and offensive line position groups are ample cause for optimism as the Spartans continue through the 2023 offseason.","Sports Illustrated Michigan State Spartans News, Analysis and More","Mel tucker, Football, Transfer portal, Tunmise adeleye, Texas a&m aggies, Michigan state football recruiting, Michigan state spartans",Matthew lounsberry,"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 20:07:26 GMT",The Spartans have beefed up along the line of scrimmage on National Signing Day...,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NDQ4Njk4NDgxMDU5NTA1/usatsi_19463248_168388427_lowres.jpg

Michigan State football has landed a commitment from South Florida transfer tailback Jaren Mangham, the older brother of current Spartans' safety Jaden Mangham and a former product of Detroit Cass Tech High School.
The elder Mangham announced his commitment to MSU via Twitter on Wednesday, in the midst of National Signing Day for high school recruits.
A member of the Class of 2019, Jaren Mangham committed to and played for MSU head coach Mel Tucker during his lone season at the helm in Colorado. Playing in all 12 games for the Buffaloes as a true freshman, Mangham tallied 441 yards and three touchdown on 107 carries. He was named to the All-Pac-12 Freshman team as a result.
After Tucker departed Colorado to become the new head coach at Michigan State ahead of the 2020 season, Mangham remained with the Buffaloes and had 35 rushing yards and two touchdowns in just four games that season.
Mangham entered the transfer portal the following offseason and landed at South Florida, where he earned honorable mention All-AAC in 2021 after 671 yards and 15 touchdowns on 160 carries for the Bulls. This past season, Mangham had just 24 carries on the year and finished with 104 yards and three touchdowns.
With two years of collegiate eligibility remaining, Mangham figures to factor in to Michigan State's tailback rotation immediately in 2023.","Sports Illustrated Michigan State Spartans News, Analysis and More","Mel tucker, Jaden mangham, South florida bulls, Michigan state spartans, Transfer portal, Jaren mangham, Michigan state football recruiting, Football",Matthew lounsberry,"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 18:06:49 GMT",The Spartans add to their offensive backfield with a familiar name...,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NDkwNzg0MDYwMjg2NDY5/usatsi_15198531_168388427_lowres.jpg

Mel Tucker and Michigan State football continue to place a heavy emphasis on adding talent from the transfer portal, and the Spartans stuck again on Wednesday when former Liberty defensive tackle Dre Butler committed to MSU.
The 6-foot-5, 300-pounder will provide Michigan State with size, depth and experience and a ready-made starter in the middle of the Spartans' defense in 2023. Even at his massive size, Butler is a guy who has the athleticism to pressure the quarterback from the D-tackle position, but the biggest value that he'll bring to MSU is the ability to clog up running lanes for opposing offensive linemen and tailbacks.
Butler started his collegiate career at Independence Community College before transferring to Auburn. After two seasons with the Tigers, Butler moved on to Liberty for the 2022 season. He played in the Flames' bowl game against Toledo on Tuesday night, hopped in the transfer portal following the game and immediately gave a verbal pledge to Michigan State on Wednesday.
In 2022, Butler finished with 22 tackles, 1.5 sacks, 1 forced fumble, and 1 fumble recovery in his lone season at Liberty. In three years of Power 5 football, Butler has tallied 42 total tackles, including 2.5 sacks.
Michigan State is shoring up the line of scrimmage on both sides of the football through transfer portal additions. In addition to Butler, the Spartans have also added Florida State transfer defensive tackle Jarrett Jackson and are firmly in the running for Texas A&M transfer DT Tunmise Adeleye — one of the top transfers on the market.","Sports Illustrated Michigan State Spartans News, Analysis and More","Dre butler, Liberty flames, Michigan state spartans, Transfer portal, Mel tucker, Michigan state football recruiting, Football",Matthew lounsberry,"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 16:20:12 GMT",The Spartans look to shore up the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball this offseason...,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NDQzOTA5ODYwOTU5OTIx/usatsi_8780664_168388427_lowres.jpg

BOOM!
Michigan State has landed arguably its top remaining recruiting target in the 2023 cycle, as JUCO transfer offensive lineman Keyshawn Blackstock has signed his letter of intent to play for the Spartans.
MSU O-line coach Chris Kapilovic was the primary recruiter for Michigan State in this recruiting battle, and Blackstone chose the Spartans over the likes of Auburn, California and Colorado.
Blackstock spent each of the last two seasons at Coffeyville Community College. He is ranked No. 8 in the nation among all junior college transfers, including the No. 1 interior offensive lineman and No. 2 JUCO from the state of Georgia, according to the 247Sports Composite rankings.
While he's listed as an interior offensive lineman by 247Sports, the 6-foot-5, 315-pounder will have an excellent chance of stepping in as a Day 1 starter for Michigan State at one of the two offensive tackle positions, opposite returning starting tackle Spencer Brown.
Offensive line is one of the most important position in need of improvement for Michigan State, and Kapilovic has taken big strides towards adding depth and talent to his position during this recruiting cycle. In addition to Blackstock, the Spartans have also signed four-star Clarkston (Mich.) interior offensive lineman Cole Dellinger and have a verbal commitment from Alabaster (Ala.) four-star offensive tackle Stanton Ramill.
The addition of Blackstock moves Michigan State's 2023 recruiting class up to No. 24 in the country with 15 total commitments.","Sports Illustrated Michigan State Spartans News, Analysis and More","Michigan state football recruiting, Mel tucker, Football, Keyshawn blackstock, Michigan state spartans, Chris kapilovic, Michigan state football",Matthew lounsberry,"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 15:20:08 GMT",The Spartans reel in arguably their top remaining target at a major position of need...,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NjAyMzY5NDU4MTIwMjE2/usatsi_19200634_168388427_lowres.jpg

Spartan Nation is ready to welcome the newest high school signees to Michigan State University! Go Green!
Wake up Spartan Nation! It's National Signing Day!
Mel Tucker and the Michigan State Spartans will welcome the next crop of Spartans today, as high school recruits can finally put pen to paper and sign their letters of intent to their university of choice.
Michigan State currently has 14 verbal commitments from the Class of 2023, and the Spartans coaching staff expects to close the deal on most, if not all, of those players today. We'll also be keeping an eye on a few uncommitted prospects that MSU is battling for during this early signing period.
As the latest news and signings unfold, Spartan Nation will be keeping fans and readers informed throughout the day with the full list of signees below:
1:19 p.m. – 3-star CB Chance Rucker; Ryan High School; Denton, TexasRankings: No. 438 nationally, No. 42 Cornerback, No. 71 in state of Texas
 Head coach Mel Tucker often says that cornerbacks are hard to find, and a football program can never have too many of them. Michigan State landed a good one in the Class of 2023 in Chance Rucker out of Ryan High School in Denton, Texas. While he’s currently listed as a three-star in 247Sports Composite rankings, Rucker has fluctuated between three and four stars throughout his recruitment. It was this 6-foot-1, 180-pounder that sparked Michigan State’s summer recruiting efforts, as Rucker was the first of six current commits to pledge to MSU in the months of June, July and August. He chose the Spartans over offers from Arkansas, Baylor, Florida and TCU, among others. Defensive back is a position of need for MSU, and secondary coach Harlon Barnett landed a guy in Rucker who can work his way up the depth chart in the coming years.
12:31 p.m. – 4-star LB Jordan Hall; IMG Academy; Bradenton, Fla.Rankings: No. 179 nationally, No. 16 Linebacker, No. 41 in state of Florida
 Any time you nab a player from IMG Academy, one of the premier high school football programs in the country, you feel good about it. A native of Virginia, Jordan Hall transferred to IMG ahead of his sophomore season and became an instant star. The four-star linebacker prospect visited Florida and Notre Dame, but committed to Michigan State following a visit on June 11. Hall chose the Spartans out of 19 scholarship offers, and cancelled visits to Michigan and North Carolina following his commitment to MSU. Defensive coordinator Scottie Hazelton was the primary recruiter in this battle, while special teams coordinator Ross Els was involved as well. After the Spartans’ linebackers struggled in pass coverage throughout the 2022 season, Hall is the type of prospect who could shore up some of those passing lanes for opposing quarterbacks. At 6-foot-2 and 225 pounds, Hall has a good mixture of size and speed that Mel Tucker covets from his linebackers. This is an excellent pickup for the Green and White.
Noon – 4-star OT Stanton Ramil; Thompson High School; Alabaster, Ala.Rankings: No. 223 nationally, No. 20 Offensive Tackle, No. 17 in state of Alabama
One of the top priorities for Michigan State is getting deeper and more talented along the offensive line, and the Spartans take a step in that direction by adding four-star offensive tackle Stanton Ramil. Coming in as the No. 240 overall player in his class, Ramil is the highest-ranked offensive tackle signee for the Spartans since 2010. Standing at 6-foot-7 and weighing 310 pounds, the native of Alabaster, Ala. was one of the most sought-after prospects in the country, garnering a whopping 33 scholarship offers. The fact that O-line coach Chris Kapilovic was able to go down into SEC country and nab a talented prospect like Ramil is a testament to Kapilovic’s recruiting chops. Ramil chose the Spartans over offers from Auburn, Tennessee, Penn State, North Carolina and Pittsburgh, among others. This one was a massive recruiting win for Michigan State.
11:50 a.m. – 4-star EDGE Bai Jobe; Community Christian School; Norman, Okla.Rankings: No. 82 nationally, No. 14 Edge Rusher, No. 1 in state of Oklahoma
 The highest-ranked commit of Mel Tucker’s three-year tenure at Michigan State has signed his national letter of intent. Four-star edge rusher Bai Jobe, a Top 100 national prospect, is officially a Spartan. Defensive line coach Marco Coleman and pass rush specialist Brandon T. Jordan led the charge for the heavily-sought-after prospect out of Norman, Okla. and gave MSU perhaps its biggest recruiting win of the past three seasons. The Spartans went right into Oklahoma’s back yard to steal Jobe right out from under the Sooners’ noses. At 6-foot-4, 215 pounds, Jobe chose Michigan State among 30 offers that included Alabama, Georgia, Miami, Texas A&M and several others. While the Spartans’ defense improved in the latter part of the 2022 season, MSU still needs to add depth and talent on defense and that’s exactly what Jobe provides.
11:16 a.m. – 3-star CB Eddie Pleasant III; Carrollwood Day High School; Tampa, Fla. Rankings: No. 873 nationally, No. 86 Cornerback, No. 127 in state of Florida
 The third-longest tenured commit in Michigan State’s 2023 recruiting class made it official today when he signed and submitted his letter of intent to play for Mel Tucker and the Spartans. Three-star cornerback Eddie Pleasant III out of Carrollwood Day High School in Tampa, Fla. is on his way to East Lansing. Pleasant was one of the earliest commits for MSU, giving his verbal pledge to area recruiter Marco Coleman (D-line coach) and secondary coach Harlon Barnett way back in April. He chose Michigan State over offers from Cincinnati, Iowa, Penn State and Utah, among others. At six feet and 175 pounds, Pleasant has a long, lean frame for MSU’s strength and conditioning staff to work with. As Michigan State tries to add depth and talent to their secondary, Pleasant is a player worth keeping an eye on in the coming years.
10:27 a.m. – 3-star ATH Jaelon Barbarin; Chaminade High School; West Hills, Calif.Rankings: No. 1135 nationally, No. 97 Athlete, No. 99 in state of California
 One of the fastest players in the country will bring that elite speed to East Lansing in 2023. While slight of build at 5-foot-9 and 190 pounds, three-star athlete Jaelon Barbarin is a certified weapon of Michigan State’s offensive coaching staff to play with. The native of West Hills, California is expected to play running back for the Spartans, but its easy to imagine this speedster catching passes out of the backfield in the not too distant future as well. Barbarin was a track star at Chaminade High School who ran a blazing career-best 10.37 seconds in the 100-meter dash. MSU running back coach Effrem Reed and head coach Mel Tucker did well to identify and snag this hidden gem off the West Coast. Barbarin was also closely considering Washington State as his recruitment came to a close, but he ultimately gave his verbal pledge to Michigan State in the days leading up to National Signing Day. Now, his letter of intent has been submitted, and Barbarin is officially a Spartan.
10:19 a.m. – 4-star QB Sam Leavitt; West Linn High School; West Linn, Ore.Rankings: No. 374 nationally, No. 23 Quarterback, No. 1 in state of Oregon
 What a job offensive coordinator Jay Johnson did in this recruitment. Michigan State long held a commitment from three-star quarterback Bo Edmundson during the 2023 cycle, but after a difficult senior year for the Austin (Texas) Lake Travis prospect, Edmundson and Michigan State parted ways. The Spartans first turned their attention towards five-star Detroit (Mich.) Martin Luther King star Dante Moore, taking a massive swing at trying to flip the Oregon commit. While that turned some heads nationwide, Michigan State ultimately fell short of swaying the mega-talented quarterback. However, Johnson landed an excellent consolation prize in four-star QB Sam Leavitt – the No. 1 player out of the state of Oregon.
10:14 a.m. – 3-star CB Sean Brown; Simi Valley High School; Simi Valley, Calif.Rankings: No. 950 nationally, No. 95 Cornerback, No. 84 in state of California
A long-time Arizona commit, three-star cornerback prospect Sean Brown flipped his commitment to Mel Tucker and the Spartans in the days leading up to the early signing period for the 2023 cycle. In addition to the Wildcats, Brown also considered Colorado, Washington State and BYU as potential landing spots to being his college career, but ultimate he submitted his letter of intent to Michigan State on National Signing Day. While he’s listed as a cornerback by 247Sports, a 6-foot-3 and 195-pound frame suggests that Brown could transition to either safety or linebacker once he arrives in East Lansing. That could be an intriguing development for Michigan State in the years to come, as the Spartans need to get better at pass coverage at both of those positions and Brown’s high school experience at cornerback could give him a bit of a head start at whichever position he ultimately plays.
10:02 a.m. – 4-star DL Jalen Thompson; Cass Technical High School; Detroit, Mich.Rankings: No. 220 nationally, No. 32 Defensive Lineman, No. 3 in state of Michigan
 The best players in Michigan, go to State! Not only did the Spartans beat their in-state rivals for this four-star defensive lineman out of Detroit, Michigan State also fended off a late surge by Ohio State and beat out a Cincinnati program that was coming off a College Football Playoff appearance last season. Ranked No. 219 overall in the country, it’s fair to wonder if Jalen Thompson is a little underrated, even as a four-star prospect. The Detroit native garnered 30 scholarship offers, including the who’s who of college football – Georgia, Notre Dame, Penn State, Tennessee, USC and others. Thompson is part of an excellent defensive line class for Michigan State. Pass rush specialist Brandon Jordan led the way in this recruitment, with a solid assist from D-line coach Marco Coleman. Those two guys were MSU’s best recruiters during the 2023 cycle, and it showed in how stacked this D-line class is for the Spartans.
9:54 a.m. – 4-star IOL Keyshawn Blackstock; Coffeyville Community College; Covington, Ga.Rankings: No. 7 JUCO transfer, No. 1 Interior Offensive Lineman, No. 2 in state of Georgia
 Though not a high school recruit, you’d be hard-pressed to find a more important piece of Michigan State’s 2023 recruiting class than junior college transfer Keyshawn Blackstock. The Spartans need help along their offensive line, and the JUCO transfer from Coffeyville Community College will provide two years of collegiate experience already when he steps foot on campus in East Lansing. According to 247Sports Composite rankings, Blackstock is the No. 7 overall JUCO transfer in the class of 2023, and the No. 1 interior offensive line. However, Michigan State offensive line coach Chris Kapilovic will give the 6-foot-5, 315-pounder a look at one of the two tackle spots in 2023. Blackstock started every game in 2022 for Coffeyville C.C. at left tackle. As the Spartans look to rebuild their offensive line ahead of the 2023 season, they add an important piece to the puzzle with this native of Covington, Ga.
9:49 a.m. – 3-star ATH Aziah Johnson; Thomas Jefferson High School; Richmond, Va.Rankings: No. 905 nationally, No. 69 Athlete, No. 24 in state of Virginia
A three-star athlete prospect who is expected to play wide receiver, Aziah Johnson sparked a late series of commitments for Michigan State in the week leading up to National Signing Day. The native of Richmond, Va. chose the Spartans over several programs that were much closer to home – North Carolina, Virginia Tech, Wake Forest and South Carolina. This was a nice recruiting win for Michigan State, which had been knocked on its heels due to several decommitments around the time of Johnson’s verbal pledge. While his recruiting ranking won’t jump out at anybody, his 6-foot-2 and 175-pound frame does stand out. After Johnson has spent some time in MSU’s strength and conditioning program, he could develop into a tough matchup for opposing defensive backs with his combination of height and speed.
8:43 a.m. – 3-star WR Jaelen Smith; Klein Cain High School; Houston, Texas Rankings: No. 695 nationally, No. 93 Wide Receiver, No. 110 in state of Texas
Michigan State added three-star wide receiver prospect Jaelen Smith on the eve of Signing Day, and the native of Houston, Texas made it official on Wednesday when he submitted his letter of intent to MSU. Smith chose the Spartans over fellow finalists Minnesota and Vanderbilt, and provides Michigan State with a versatile weapon. At 6-foot-1 and 185 pounds, Smith projects as a wide receiver at the collegiate level, but he also played both running back and quarterback at Klein Cain High School. During his senior season, Smith supplemented his 34 receptions for 695 receiving yards and 10 receiving touchdowns with 830 rushing yards and 10 rushing touchdowns on the ground. The do-it-all athlete also completed 35-of-70 pass attempts for 452 yards, four touchdowns and three interceptions, and also returned a kickoff for a score. It will be interesting to see how MSU offensive coordinator Jay Johnson utilizes Smith’s unique skillset in the Spartan offense.
8:07 a.m. – 4-star DL Andrew Depaepe; Pleasant Valley High School; Bettendorf, IowaRankings: No. 137 nationally, No. 16 Defensive Lineman, No. 2 in state of Iowa
 One of the earliest Michigan State commitments in the 2023 class, four-star defensive lineman Andrew Depaepe has made it official after signing with the Spartans. The native of Bettendorf, Iowa has been one of the most vocal and active recruiters in the class since committing to MSU way back in February. Depaepe is the highest-rated defensive line signee for the Spartans since 2016, and he was the first recruiting win for MSU pass rush specialist Brandon Jordan. While listed as a D-lineman, Depaepe is projected to play defensive end for the Spartans. At 6-foot-5 and 245 pounds, the product out of Pleasant Valley High School has an excellent frame for Michigan State’s strength and conditioning staff to work with. Throw in the training that Depaepe will receive from a specialist like Jordan, and the Spartans have a potential star on their hands with this Top 150 prospect.
7:32 a.m. – 4-star TE Brennan Parachek; Dexter High School; Dexter, Mich.Rankings: No. 327 nationally, No. 18 Tight End, No. 6 in state of Michigan
In the week leading up to National Signing Day, Michigan State turned some heads by adding three transfer tight ends in four days’ time. Now, the Spartans have added another talented tight end prospect from the high school ranks in four-star Brennan Parachek. The native of Dexter, Mich. was Michigan State’s first commit in the 2023 class – way back on Sept. 28, 2021 – and that commitment held strong until Parachek put pen to paper and signed his national letter of intent today. In the last couple weeks, in-state rival Michigan made a run at flipping the four-star, but the blood in this Michiganders veins runs Green. In addition to the Wolverines, Michigan State beat out the likes of Kentucky, Arizona State and Purdue for Parachek. While the Spartans have a lot of options at tight end for the 2023 season, I feel comfortable saying that Parachek has the highest long-term ceiling of all of them.
7:21 a.m. – 4-star IOL Cole Dellinger; Clarkston High School; Clarkston, Mich.Rankings: No. 407 nationally, No. 27 Interior Offensive Lineman, No. 7 in state of Michigan
Any time you can keep a four-star kid from you backyard home, that’s a win. When that same kid player plays at a position of need, that makes the recruiting victory all the more sweet. Michigan State is getting a player that fits those descriptions in four-star offensive lineman Cole Dellinger out of Clarkston, Michigan. In my opinion, there is no single position group that the Spartans need to improve more than their offensive line, and Dellinger is a major step towards that goal. Ranked the No. 7 player in the state of Michigan by the 247Sports Composite rankings, Dellinger stands at 6-foot-4 and weighs in at 280 pounds – a good starting point for a high school recruit. Dellinger chose Michigan State over fellow finalists Purdue and LSU. His brother, Garrett, was a four-star and Top 100 player in the class of 2021 who signed with LSU. It’s impressive that MSU offensive line coach Chris Kapilovic and head coach Mel Tucker were able to fend off the Tigers for the younger Dellinger brother.","Sports Illustrated Michigan State Spartans News, Analysis and More","Michigan state spartans, Michigan state football, Michigan state football recruiting, National signing day, Football, Class of 2023, Mel tucker",Matthew lounsberry,"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 13:16:01 GMT",It's National Signing Day!

Just hours away from the early signing period, Michigan State football has added to its 2023 recruiting class.
On Tuesday evening, three-star Houston (Texas) Klein Cain High School wide receiver Jaelen Smith announced his commitment to the Spartans, choosing MSU over fellow finalists Minnesota and Vanderbilt.
According to the 247Sports Composite rankings, Smith is ranked No. 695 overall and the No. 93 wide receiver in the Class of 2023, and the No. 110 player from the state of Texas. He visited Michigan State back on Dec. 2, and chose the Spartans on the eve of the early National Signing Day (Dec. 21).
At 6-foot-1 and 185 pounds, Smith has good size and a nice frame for MSU's strength and conditioning staff to work with once he arrives in East Lansing. Wide receiver coach Courtney Hawkins was the primary recruiter for the Spartans in this battle. 
Smith provides Michigan State's offensive coaching staff with a versatile weapon. As a senior, he compiled 695 receiving yards and 10 touchdowns on 34 receptions as a receiver, adding 830 rushing yards and 10 rushing touchdowns as a ball carrier. Smith played some quarterback as well, throwing for 452 yards and four touchdowns while completing 35-of-70 attempts.
With Smith in the fold, Michigan State's 2023 recruiting class is up to 14 commitments and the Spartans' class is now ranked No. 26 in the country and No. 4 in the Big Ten Conference. Of the 14 committed prospects in MSU's 2023 class, eight are listed as four-stars. That's one shy of the program record in the 247Sports era of recruiting (since 2000).","Sports Illustrated Michigan State Spartans News, Analysis and More","Michigan state spartans, Michigan state football recruiting, Football, Mel tucker, Jaelen smith, Michigan state football",Matthew lounsberry,"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 03:58:30 GMT",The Spartans add to their 2023 class on the doorstep of Signing Day...,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NDIyOTQxNTYyMTg1Mzkz/usatsi_15198524_168388427_lowres.jpg
https://www.si.com/college/michiganstate/football/michigan-state-spartans-football-recruiting-defensive-tackle-jarrett-jackson-transfer-florida-seminoles-msu-mel-tucker-122022,BREAKING: Defensive Tackle Transfer Commits To Michigan State,"The Spartans remain active in the transfer portal following the 2022 season...
Welcome to the new December normal for college football. Coaching staffs across the nation are scrounging the transfer portal of available talent, and that's absolutely happening in East Lansing, Mich. as well.
On Tuesday evening, Michigan State football landed another addition out of the portal — former Florida State Seminole defensive tackle Jarrett Jackson.
Next year in East Lansing, Jackson will play for his third different program in six years. A former three-star high school recruit in the Class of 2018, Jackson signed with Louisville and played in 10 games as a true freshman. He recorded 16 tackles, including three tackles for loss and two sacks for the Cardinals.
Jackson sat out of the 2019 season after transferring to Florida State, and played in just one game for the Seminoles in 2020. Then, in 2021, Jackson played in 10 games with one start for FSU, recording 16 tackles, including 1.5 for loss and a half-sack. He added one quarterback hurry and a pass breakup.
This past season, injuries limited Jackson to just 14 snaps in his final four appearances with Florida State. He played in 10 games again for the Seminoles in 2022, recording 12 tackles.
After Michigan State saw defensive tackles Jalen Hunt and Dashaun Mallory enter the transfer portal this offseason, it was important for the Spartans to rebuild its defensive depth up front. MSU is also the current 'crystal ball' favorite to land former Texas A&M defensive tackle Tunmise Adeleye out of the transfer portal.
Adeleye, who signed with the Aggies in 2021, is a former four-star and Top 50 national recruit out of Katy (Texas) Thompson High School.","Sports Illustrated Michigan State Spartans News, Analysis and More","Michigan state football recruiting, Football, Mel tucker, Michigan state spartans, Transfer portal, Florida state seminoles, Jarrett jackson",Matthew lounsberry,"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 00:32:12 GMT",The Spartans remain active in the transfer portal following the 2022 season...,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NDAwMTA3OTA1OTUxNDA5/usatsi_6674388_168388427_lowres.jpg
