https://www.si.com/college/georgia/news/ohio-states-2023-recruiting-class,Ohio State Takes a Few Losses in Recruiting Prior to Matchup with UGA,"The Ohio State Buckeyes disappoints fans after finishing with the 6th ranked recruiting class after National Signing Day.
After early signing day has come and gone and teams roster's for the 2023 season have become more and more clear, Ohio State fans seem to feel as though the Buckeyes recruiting class for this season may have left a lot on the table.
Though Ryan Day and company were able to lock up the no.6 ranked class in the nation and by no means preformed poorly, there were a couple of big time recruits that the Buckeyes seemingly missed out on. 5 star edge rusher, and now Georgia commit Damon Wilson was 1 of 3 edge rushers that the Buckeyes failed to land after recruiting heavily. The others, Keon Keeley and Matayo Uiagalelei elected to sign with Alabama and Oregon. 
As well as missing on a couple of key recruits, the Buckeyes also lost 5 commitments to other schools which included 4 star cornerback Dijon Johnson who signed with Florida. Other de-commits included 4 star cornerback Kayin Lee, 4 star tight end Ty Lockwood, 4 star running back Mark Fletcher, and 3 star quarterback Brock Glenn.
Ohio State head coach Ryan Day alluded to the fact that NIL deals had a major effect on this year's recruiting class and even hinted that certain players went elsewhere for better deals. He also stated that he believes that current signees will have tremendous NIL opportunities and cited that the school's ability to produce high level NFL talent year in and year out is what helped current signees make their decision. 
While the Ohio State faithful may currently be disappointed and critical of Ryan Day for the results of this year's recruiting class. Buckeye fans will certainly forget the short comings of the 2023 recruiting class, should Ohio State win the College Football Playoff this season.

https://www.si.com/college/georgia/football/sec-east-team-making-big-moves-in-the-transfer-portal,SEC East Team Making Big Moves in the Transfer Portal,"An SEC East team has been making significant moves in the Transfer Portal as they look to supplant Georgia at the top of the division.
Teams have been restocking around the country as we wrap up the early signing period. A bunch of familiar names finished at the top of the recruiting rankings, but many of the teams that finished outside of the top 10 have made significant additions in the Transfer Portal.
Over the past week, Georgia landed two outstanding transfer receivers: Rara Thomas from Mississippi State and Dominic Lovett from Missouri, but another SEC East team had a big week in the Transfer Portal as well. 
Mark Stoops and the Kentucky Wildcats wasted no time replacing NFL-bound quarterback Will Levis. On December 5th, the Wildcats landed former NC State quarterback Devin Leary. Though injured for a majority of this season, Leary has shown elite ability. In 2021, he threw for 3,433 yards and 35 touchdowns with just 5 interceptions. 
To go along with the Leary news, there are reports out there linking Rams offensive coordinator Liam Coen to the vacant OC position at Kentucky. Coen served as the WIldcat’s offensive coordinator in 2021, before jumping to the NFL.
The Wildcats have also used the Transfer Portal to get Leary some protection. Former Alabama offensive lineman Tanner Bowles and ex-Northern Illinois tackle Marques Cox have both transferred to Kentucky.
Defensively, Kentucky went out and snagged ex-Ohio State safety Jantzen Dunn. The 6-foot-2 safety was a 4-star prospect in the 2021 class.
All of their movement in the Transfer Portal comes with good reason, as Kentucky signed just the 32nd-best class per 247Sports. 
With a ton of quarterback production leaving the division - Tennessee’s Hendon Hooker, Florida’s Anthony Richardson, and Georgia’s Stetson Bennett are all off to the NFL - Kentucky will have the most proven signal-caller to start 2023 in Devin Leary. They’ve shown the ability to hang with Georgia in the past; now they’re hoping they can jump the Dawgs.

https://www.si.com/college/georgia/recruiting/recruiting-who-could-be-the-next-commitment-for-georgia-football,Who Could Be the Next Commit for Georgia?,"It has been a busy past couple of days for the Bulldogs recruiting-wise. They wrapped up early national signing day with 25 players signing their letter of intent. The day after, the Bulldogs reeled in both Rara Thomas and Dominic Lovett from the transfer portal. Two wide receivers that will be immediate contributors for the Bulldogs next season. 
With most of Georgia's 2023 recruiting class being locked in, who could be the next player to commit to the Bulldogs? 
One player that Georgia is still gunning after is the 2023 tight end prospect, Duce Robinson, who is rated as the best tight end in the nation for this year's class and ranked 30th overall by 247Sports. Georgia already solidified commitments from Pearce Spurlin and Lawson Luckie, so adding Robinson alongside those two tight ends would make for a loaded tight-end class for the Bulldogs this cycle. 
Looking at players available in the portal, Deyon ""Smoke"" Bouie out of Texas A&M is a player that could very well end up in Athens. Coming out of high school, Bouie was listed as a four-star recruit, rated as the seventh-best player in the state of Georgia and 47th overall in the country by 247Sports. 
The former Aggie was at one point committed to the Bulldogs during his high school recruitment and remained committed for about seven months until he announced he was de-committing from Georgia. 
Kirby Smart and his staff remained in pursuit of Bouie until pen met paper and he finally decided to play for Jimbo Fisher and Texas A&M. Now with Bouie looking for a new home, the door opens back up for Georgia to get the former Aggie in a red and black jersey. 
The highly-touted defensive back is originally from Bainbridge, Georgia so perhaps a return to home is the next step in Bouie's college career. Georgia has already taken two players from the portal and Bouie might become the third to join the Bulldogs for the 2023 college football season.

https://www.si.com/college/georgia/recruiting/2023-class-superlatives-for-georgias-no-2-overall-class,Georgia's 2023 Class Superlatives,"Here are the senior superlatives for UGAs 2023 signing class
The 2023 high school signing class is all but in the books for head coach Kirby Smart and the Georgia Bulldogs. They have LOIs from 26 of 28 verbal commits, with Jamal Meriweather and Raymond Cottrell still firmly in the fold for the Bulldogs, we have a fairly clear picture of what this signing class finally looks like. 
So, as the Bulldogs finish up their portal season of additions and wait for the decision of TE Duce Robinson, we bring you the superlatives from this year's current class.  
EDGE Damon Wilson
It's not bold to believe Wilson has 1st round upside. After all, he is rated as a 5-star recruit. Wilson's measurables at 6'4 230 checks a lot of boxes for NFL scouts, and he only has more room to fill out and get bigger. Wilson is a special athlete that showcases serious speed and bend when coming off the edge. He can also play in space, showing the ability to impact the game in pass coverage and the ability to run sideline to sideline. Wilson is one of the best overall athletes in the 2023 class, and once he adjusts to the physicality of the SEC, the sky is the limit for Wilson. 
DL Jordan Hall
With at the very least Jalen Carter leaving UGA at the end of the season, that creates some opportunities on the interior defensive line, and I believe Jordan Hall has what it takes to immediately enter the rotation for UGA. Hall is a 6'5 300-pound thumper that overwhelms opposition with his sheer size and strength, and he will only get bigger from here. Not only is he a physical force of nature, but he is also extremely athletic and quick off the ball. At times, he lines up at the EDGE spot to rush the passer. With Hall in the middle of the UGA defense, the Dawgs will have a freak athlete with a wide variety of tools under his belt. 
DB Kyron Jones
You have to check a few boxes to play CB at Georgia. You have to be tall, physical, and fast. Jones certainly fits all those descriptions. Not only is he 6'1 with 10.3 100-meter speed, but he also played mostly RB in HS, so he is used to being physical. With Jones having to make a change to CB, he will certainly need some development before he sees the field. However, with some seasoning, there is reason to believe he can carve out a significant role in the secondary by the time his college career is over. UGA has a history of developing lower-rated DB prospects into impact players. Most recently, Javon Bullard
EDGE Damon Wilson
Wilson takes home his second superlative for the 2023 class. As far as the upside is concerned, Wilson is undoubtedly at the top of the list when it comes to UGA signees, at least in my opinion. He is already an incredibly gifted athlete with amazing speed and finesse, but he has yet to fully maximize his frame. After a few seasons in UGA's weight program, I believe Wilson can transform his body and become an even freakier athlete. 
DB AJ Harris 
You could really give this role to a couple of guys, but I will give this one to Harris. Not only did Harris's commitment represent the turning point for UGAs 2023 class, but he also played a critical role in recruiting others to Athens with him. Most notably, Samuel M'Pemba. Harris was a priority recruit for Kirby Smart, and he made sure to bring some help with him to Athens. 
OLBs Coach Chidera Uzo-Diribe 
When UGA hired Uzo-Diribe, everyone knew they were getting a young and energetic rising star to lead a critical position on defense. However, I don't think anyone expected him to flex his muscles as a recruiter the way that he did this cycle. He started off by getting Gabriel Harris on board, then followed that up by adding Samuel M'Pemba and Damon Wilson. All three guys are bonafide elite prospects, and could all end up developing into difference-makers on the trail. By all accounts, Uzo-Diribe has already made waves in future recruiting classes as well. As long as he is at UGA, expect the Dawgs to get quite the yearly haul on OLBs. ","Sports Illustrated Georgia Bulldogs News, Analysis and More","Georgia recruiting, Recruiting, Georgia football",Connor jackson,"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 15:44:36 GMT",Here are the senior superlatives for UGAs 2023 signing class,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NjQ5MzgwMDIyNjU4NTg0/7fd0b02d-78b5-40e6-b1c0-bfd4e28943b4.jpg
https://www.si.com/college/georgia/news/georgia-lands-transfer-dominic-lovett,BREAKING: Georgia Lands Another Transfer Wide Receiver,"Dominic Lovett - the SEC's sixth-leading receiver - announced that he will be transferring to Georgia.
Just hours after landing Mississippi State transfer Rara Thomas, Georgia dipped into the Transfer Portal again, this time for former Missouri wide receiver Dominic Lovett.
As a sophomore, Lovett starred for Missouri, hauling in 56 passes for 846 yards and three touchdowns. 
His 846 receiving yards were good for third in the SEC, behind only Tennessee's Jalin Hyatt (1,267) and South Carolina's Antwane Wells Jr. (898).
Against Georgia on October 1st, Lovett was able to do some damage, reeling in 6 passes for 84 yards. His best game came against South Carolina, when he caught 10 balls for 148 yards in Missouri's 23-10 win.
The 5-foot-10 receiver from Illinois helped lead his his East St. Louis team to an undefeated 14-0 record and the Illinois state title in 2019. A 4-star prospect in the 2021 class, Dominic Lovett carried offers from Alabama, Auburn, and Missouri, among others.
Missouri quarterback Brady Cook described how tough it will be to replace Lovett.
""Obviously he's a great player,"" Cook said of Lovett. ""Obviously tough to replace a guy like that.""
Thursday was a huge day for Georgia; the Bulldogs received commitments from 4-star defensive tackle Jordan Hall, Mississippi State wide receiver Rara Thomas, and Lovett.
No. 1 ranked Georgia (13-0) takes on No. 4 Ohio State (11-1) in the College Football Playoff Semifinals on December 31st in the Chick-Fil-A Peach Bowl. The game is set for an 8:00 p.m. kick on ESPN.

https://www.si.com/college/georgia/recruiting/breaking-dominic-lovett-commits-to-georgia-football,BREAKING: Another Elite SEC WR Transfer Commits to Georgia,"UGA adds yet another high-caliber player from the portal, and it's another elite WR.
Shortly after adding Mississippi State WR transfer Rara Thomas, the Dawgs have tapped back into the transfer portal to add another big-time SEC WR transfer. This time, it's Dominic Lovett from Missouri. 
In 2022, Dominic Lovett led Missouri and finished 4th in the SEC in receiving yards with 846. Against UGA, Lovett caught 6 passes for 84 yards. His best game of the year came against South Carolina, where he caught 10 passes for 148 yards.
According to the 247Sports portal rankings, Lovett is the best available WR in the portal and the 7th best overall. Out of high school, Lovett was a 4-star recruit out of East St. Louis (Il.) and held offers from schools like Missouri, Alabama, Arkansas, and Auburn.
Since Lovett entered the portal, Georgia identified him as a potential addition. Intel suggests that UGA was the main player from the beginning and that never wavered.
Lovett will give UGA a great athlete at the WR spot that can play all over the field and attack at each level. When you pair him up with Rara Thomas, one could say that UGA got the best portal haul at the WR spot in the entire country. 
BOLD indicates an official LOI has been turned in.
Italics indicate the player is already enrolled and practicing.

https://www.si.com/college/georgia/news/jordan-hall-signs-with-georgia,Jordan Hall Signs With Georgia,"Georgia beats out Alabama, LSU, and Florida for 4-star defensive lineman Jordan Hall.
Jordan Hall, one of the nation’s top defensive linemen, has signed his National Letter of Intent. The monster defensive lineman is officially a Georgia Bulldog.
Ranked as the nation’s 9th best defensive lineman - and 73rd overall - by 247Sports, Hall is a mountain of a man. At nearly 6-foot-5, Hall has the type of length Kirby Smart covets at the line of scrimmage. At 300 pounds, he has the mass to be a contributor early. 
Georgia had to beat out Alabama, LSU, and Florida for Hall’s services.
During his time at Westside High School in Jacksonville, Hall compiled 19 sacks and over 60 tackles for loss. 
Dawgs Daily's Connor Jackson had this to say about Hall back in November:
""Along with M'Pemba, UGA has been pursuing Hall for a while. Hall, one of the best available defensive linemen in the country, has made numerous stops in Athens, and the Dawgs have seemed like the team to beat for some time now.
Hall keeps his recruitment under wraps, so it's hard to tell exactly where this one is headed. However, we remain confident that he will end up in the class."" 
Hall will help to replenish the depth of a defensive line that is losing some key contributors, including All-American Jalen Carter.

https://www.si.com/college/georgia/news/rara-thomas-commits-to-georgia,Breaking: Rara Thomas Commits to Georgia,"Mississippi State wide receiver Rara Thomas has announced that he will be transferring to Georgia.
Georgia has landed a big time player out of the Transfer Portal just a day after signing the No. 2 class during the early signing period.
Rara Thomas, a wide receiver out of Mississippi State, committed to Georgia per a post on his Twitter.
Thomas was a stud for Mississippi State, and will certainly be a huge producer in Todd Monken’s offense. Over 19 games, Thomas hauled in 62 catches for 878 yards and 12 touchdowns.
At 6-foot-2, 200 pounds, Thomas has the size to line up at the X or for Georgia, and would be an excellent pairing next to Adonai Mitchell and Ladd McConkey out at the Z.
Thomas will have two more years of eligibility at Georgia. The Bulldogs were looking for a receiver in the Transfer Portal, and Kirby Smart got his guy.

https://www.si.com/college/georgia/recruiting/georgia-football-recruiting-2023-class-reaction,Buying Stock: 5 Georgia Signees to Invest In,"Here are 5 Georgia Signees you need to buy stock in.
The 2023 signing class is all but in the books with early national signing day bringing in 24 letters of intent from 26 commits, with two targets — Jordan Hall (Dec. 22) & Duce Robinson (February) — still left on the board for the Bulldogs along with a few expected portal additions. 
So, with the proverbial bow wrapped atop this signing class, let's invest in a few ""stocks"" shall we? 
1. DL Jamaal Jarrett
Jordan Davis did wonders for UGA during his career, and you best believe that the Dawgs have been trying to find a similar guy to play on their defensive front. Standing at 6'6 and north of 350 pounds, Jarrett is about as close as you can get to Jordan Davis. With that size, you best believe that he will be physically overwhelming for almost any offensive lineman he goes up against. This means that he will demand double teams, freeing up some of his other teammates to go to work. Jarrett isn't just limited to his size and strength. Believe it or not, he is athletic enough to play all over the defensive line, even at defensive end on the high school ranks. It's hard to see Jarrett not quickly becoming a staple on the UGA defensive front, which is why you should buy stock in him now. One will recall Jordan Davis being implemented into a football team in 2018 that was being bludgeoned by the run before the then-freshman stabilized things. 
2. WR Anthony Evans
Each cycle, UGA makes it a priority to add a speedy playmaker at WR. UGA had quite the haul at the receiver spot in the 2023 cycle, but none have the speed that Anthony Evans does. Evans runs a 10.27 100 meter, making him one of the fastest players in the country. With his speed, he will serve as a deep ball threat for UGA, but his game isn't limited to that. He is surprisingly physical for a smaller receiver, showing the ability to climb the ladder and highpoint the football. Along with his track speed, he is fairly twitchy as well, which means he could take the ball to the house on a screen or route underneath. His speed alone will allow him to iron out a role early on in his career, and as he adjusts to the game, he could start to develop into a big-time weapon for Todd Monken. 
3. DB Joenel Aguero
Aguero is yet another Georgia signee that has 1st round-pick upside. Aguero is projected at safety, but he is so gifted as an athlete that he could play on both sides of the ball and produce at a high level. Aguero is a true ""striker"" style defensive back, flying down the field to deliver jarring blows on receivers. I would describe him as having a  ""heat-seeking missile"" playstyle. Along with his physical attributes, Aguero is a smooth runner that can match up man-to-man against receivers without posing much of a matchup problem. Aguero has SEC tools and plays a violent brand of football. Once he spends a few years honing in on his game, he has the potential to develop into a bonafide NFL prospect.
4. DB Kyron Jones
Jones is listed as an RB by recruiting services but is projected to play DB at the next level. More specifically, cornerback. At Georgia, you have to be long, fast, and physical to play CB. Jones checks all those boxes. He has a stout 6'1 200-pound frame, already physically ready to play DB in the SEC. As far as speed, he has 10.3 100-meter speed and is used to being physical with his experience as an RB. Jones will need some development before he is ready to enter the rotation, especially as a tackler in the open field, but with his physical tools and UGAs track record with developing under-the-radar DBs, Jones could have as bright of a future as anyone in UGAs defensive backfield. 
5. Joshua Miller
According to most recruiting services, Miller is listed as one of UGAs lowest rated signees in the 2023 recruiting class. So, if you want to pinpoint a guy that could outplay his ranking, Miller is a perfect candidate. To play offensive line in the SEC, you have to be built well and have to be a great athlete, especially at UGA. Miller fits that mold. Standing at around 6'5 305, Miller has a great frame to build upon and has the required athleticism to spare. He showcases the ability to fly down the field and search for defenders to get his hands on. Spends most of his time at offensive tackle, where his athleticism and twitchiness translate to his pass set. Miller is a little raw and needs some development, but he checks so many physical boxes. After a year or two, don't be surprised to see Miller creeping up the depth chart.

https://www.si.com/college/georgia/news/travis-hunter-commits-will-it-be-georgia-football,BREAKING: Travis Hunter Makes Transfer Decision,"A sudden turn of events has led Travis Hunter to announce his decision. Will he join head coach Deion Sanders at Colorado, head home to Georgia, or land elsewhere?
Travis Hunter has announced his college decision in an unthinkable turn of events. It isn't the first time he's owned the news cycle during early national signing day, as last year, he spurned Florida State to sign with Jackson State.
After an impressive freshman season, Hunter entered the transfer portal. Head coach Deion Sanders left for Colorado in search of greater opportunities and will likely bring several Jackson State players along with him.
However, Hunter ensured that everyone knew he wouldn't blindly follow Sanders. He weighed his decision carefully and reportedly was in talks with Georgia and head coach Kirby Smart.
Georgia was the first school to get Hunter on campus while he was committed to Florida State. Hunter hadn't visited any college campus outside of Tallahassee in years, and that time in Athens opened his mind to other possibilities.
Coming out of high school, Hunter was one of the most athletic talents we had seen. He has an NFL future at either wide receiver or corner, and he will have his pick wherever he goes.
He posted two messages to his Twitter profile on Wednesday afternoon, saying that if fans got him to 100,000 subscribers on Youtube, he would announce his commitment.
The public answered the call, and Hunter returned the favor. He announced that he would transfer to Colorado.
