The pressure was on Will Stein from the moment he was hired at Oregon on Dec. 7.
Following Kenny Dillingham's departure from Eugene to Arizona State, Stein quickly boarded a plane to Detroit to visit the headliner in Dan Lanning's 2023 recruiting class Martin Luther King quarterback Dante Moore. 
The visit was an important one, as Oregon's new offensive coordinator laid out his best pitch to keep Moore locked in with the Ducks amid a late push from Chip Kelly at UCLA. Moore would eventually flip his commitment to the Bruins on Dec. 19.
Despite Bo Nix announcing his return to Eugene for the 2023 season, Stein still needed to find a quarterback to build depth in his room. On the surface he had just two days to get it done before the early signing period began on Dec. 21. 
But the Ducks had been working behind the scenes, taking a trip out to Dripping Springs, Texas for an in-home visit with quarterback Austin Novosad, who had been committed to Baylor since last December. They parlayed a strong in-home visit to get the Adidas All-American signal caller to visit Oregon the weekend before the early signing period.

That trip looked like it was the pivotal moment in this recruitment, as Stein was able to sell Novosad on his offensive vision and playing his college football in Eugene. the Ducks would sign Novosad on the first day of the early signing period.
There was some skepticism surrounding Stein's hire, maybe not as a play caller, but as a recruiter. It's not often that you're pursuing or landing talent of Novosad's caliber at UTSA.
But Dan Lanning never had a doubt Stein would be comfortable on the recruiting trail.
""Will's a guy that's felt very strong from the moment he stepped on campus about Austin,"" Lanning said during his national signing day press conference. ""Obviously Austin's a guy that he had a relationship with all the way back to when Austin was in eighth grade. That's a place where Will's relationships really paid off and he obviously did a phenomenal job there closing out.""
Novosad gives Oregon one of the top arms in the country from the 2023 class. His stellar play throughout his high school career earned him a spot at the Elite 11 finals in the summer, as he lead Dripping Springs to three consecutive appearances in the Texas State playoffs during his high school career. 
As a three-year starter he threw for 8,983 yards, completing 64.5% of his passes for 114 touchdowns against just 18 interceptions. He's a special talent that will be welcome addition in Eugene.
""He has the ability to place the ball,"" Lanning said of Oregon's 2023 quarterback signee. ""I think if you watch his film you're gonna see some really accurate throws and challenging throws. A lot of quarterbacks might be able to throw a deep ball and throw some quick game throws. One thing that shows up consistently with Austin is his ability to throw intermediate routes really accurately. I think that's hard to do in football.""
You could make the argument that getting Nix to return was Stein's first big recruiting win, but earning Novosad's signature at the eleventh hour is a look to the program's future and one that helped minimize the damage of losing Dante Moore to UCLA.
Now the Ducks have another player they can develop behind Nix during the 2023 season and his polished skillset should translate well to Stein's offense.

https://www.si.com/college/oregon/recruiting/torres-take-what-to-make-of-oregons-splash-during-the-early-signing-period,Torres' Take: What to Make of Oregon's Splash During the Early Signing Period,"The Ducks are tearing up the recruiting trail at an unreal clip.
Wow. Just wow. What an absolutely insane couple of days it's been for Oregon on the recruiting trail. 
As I sat in my hotel room I couldn't write fast enough to keep up with the seven commitments that Oregon would land on Wednesday to kick off the early signing period.
Now that things have slowed down just a bit, I wanted to touch on some of the biggest names that dominated the storylines of Oregon football recruiting and talk about what they mean for Dan Lanning and the Ducks.
EDGE Matayo Uiagalelei (Bellflower, CA)
Even though Austin Novosad's commitment received a ton of attention--and rightfully so, this was the commitment that took the cake for me. I've covered Uiagalelei's recruitment pretty closely this season, but I never felt like Oregon was the clear-cut favorite to secure his commitment. 
Even after landing in his top three, I still thought USC and Ohio State had the best chances. But I never said the Ducks were out, and knew that this staff would keep pushing until the pen met paper.
Why is Uiagalelei such a huge addition? 
This is the type of recruit that you bring in Dan Lanning and Tosh Lupoi to land. Despite having some solid players in the trenches the past couple years, the defensive line and front seven have been severely lacking for Oregon. You need multiple guys that can get after the quarterback to get this team where it wants to go and Matayo is a player that knows how to disrupt an offense.
Beating out Lincoln Riley and USC is an absolute statement for Oregon's battle on the recruiting trail in Southern California, which promises to be entertaining for years to come.
QB Austin Novasad (Dripping Springs, TX)
Novosad quickly stole the headlines after he became priority No. 1 for Will Stein. With Dante Moore defecting to UCLA, the Ducks needed to act fast and they did just that. 
Flipping a Texas kid from Baylor is nothing to scoff at. Just look at Notre Dame and Ohio State. They both tried earlier in this cycle and weren't able to pull it off.
Novosad's addition adds to a quarterback room that's severely lacking depth and gives Oregon someone else to learn from Bo Nix and develop in 2023. He may not be the most physically imposing quarterback, but he's got a quick release, is accurate, and put up numbers against top talent in Texas. Hard to ask for much more than that.
WR Jurrion Dickey (East Palo Alto, CA)
Dickey had been a long-time commit, but he certainly wasn't an easy player for the Ducks to hang on to. Tennesse, Texas A&M and Penn State all stayed in the mix, even though some of those schools didn't offer him until he earned his fifth star.
What makes Dickey's signature even more important?
When I spoke with him in October he told me he was leaning more toward signing in February. I kept it close to the vest, but part of the reason for that was because he wanted to take all five of his official visits.
The staff got him on campus last weekend looking to shut things down and then inked their top offensive commit on Wednesday. HUGE.
CB Daylen Austin (Long Beach, CA)
Austin was another recruitment I've tracked very closely since moving to Southern California. His commitment came as no surprise, as he told me Oregon was the school most likely to pull off a flip when I talked to him after his LSU official visit. 
However, he was planning to take the process a bit slower since he's a track guy which makes flipping AND signing him during the early signing period feel like double dipping. You have to give Rashad Wadood a ton of credit here, as he continues to establish himself as one of the most important pieces in Oregon's efforts to recruit Southern California.
Austin's addition gives a  cornerback group that struggled all season (aside from Christian Gonzalez) a long, athletic playmaker that has an opportunity to make a serious impact in Eugene.
CB Caleb Presley (Seattle, WA)
With Austin flipping, losing Presley doesn't feel too significant for Oregon. I liked Presley and what he brought to the table, but I don't think this hurts the Ducks in the long run.
Washington will gloat about flipping a big-time recruit from their rivals, but Demetrice Martin and the Ducks will be just fine.
RB Jayden Limar (Lake Stevens, WA)
This was another big flip for the Ducks. They didn't really need another running back from a numbers standpoint, but you aren't going to turn away a player like him. 
Notre Dame started to feel shaky about his commitment down the home stretch and Carlos Locklyn was in a perfect spot to capitalize. Limar may not get the national buzz he deserves playing in Washington, but he has a ton of upside as a 2,000-yard rusher this year and someone who provides added value catching the ball out of the backfield. The rich get richer in Eugene and the backfield remains loaded despite losing Byron Cardwell (Cal) and Sean Dollars (Nevada).
DB Solomon Davis (Covina, CA)
I won't lie. This commitment fired me up. Davis was the first player I ever predicted to Oregon since I started my career covering recruiting. 
Oregon had their eyes on him for a while as one of the top defensive backs in Southern California but he flew under the radar a bit at Charter Oak. This one was going to be tough for the Ducks to lose following his de-commitment from Arizona as the staff really went all-in with multiple home visits and Southern California connections throughout the staff and roster.
Again, another really solid player at a major position of need.
OL Ajani Cornelius (Harlem, NY)
Had to stay up a bit later for this one, but it was worth it. Cornelius was arguably the biggest name at offensive line in the transfer portal and the Ducks put themselves in a great spot to capitalize once they got him on campus for an official.
With all the veterans they're set to lose, the transfer portal gives you the chance to add some proven production here at a position of need. Paring him with Junior Angilau out of Texas, along with five other commits (four signees), Adrian Klemm is making it a point to keep his room stocked with capable players.
EDGE Blake Purchase (Inglewood, CO)
This was another big name to track as the first day of the signing period wound down. Purchase was another guy that had been committed for a while, but things got a little interesting when his letter still hadn't come in after day one.
That's partially because Deion Sanders was making a big push to flip the No. 1 player in Colorado to the Buffaloes. But the Ducks were able to hold on.
I talked earlier about how Oregon's play in the front seven hasn't been anywhere close to where it needs to be. Purchase is a player that people around the program have told me they feel can make a legitimate impact from day one. So you can see why it was so important they kept him in the fold.
S Peyton Bowen (Denton, TX)
I won't spend a lot of time, but I still wanted to touch on Bowen.
I was absolutely shocked when he committed to Oregon on Wednesday. Like, completely floored. I knew the Ducks were in the mix late but I wasn't expecting much to come of the late buzz.
Even though he flipped his commitment to Oklahoma on Thursday, this 2023 class is special and knocking on the door of the best class in Oregon's history. Oh, and did I mention it's Dan Lanning's first full recruiting cycle with the Ducks?
If anything you should view Bowen's commitment, albeit short, as a sign for things to come in Oregon recruiting. Expect them to continue to be in contention for players of his caliber in Texas and across the country on a yearly basis.
So while his loss stings, but this was still an unreal close by this coaching staff. They addressed a ton of needs and they're still in the mix for some elite talent in 2023.

It's been a wild past couple of days on the recruiting trail for the Oregon Ducks, who landed commitments from All-Americans Matayo Uiagalelei and Daylen Austin--naming just a few blue-chip recruits to in their national letters of intent.
Taking a break from the recruiting action, Oregon junior linebacker Noah Sewell announced his declaration for the NFL Draft on Tuesday.
""My family came to the U.S. more than 10 years ago to follow a dream,"" Sewell wrote in a social media post. ""Today, I am following a personal dream I have had since I was a child. I have watched my three older brothers play professionally, and now it is my turn. After three memorable years at Oregon, I am officially declaring for the 2023 NFL Draft.""
Oregon's star linebacker is not expected to play against North Carolina in the Holiday Bowl, which is scheduled for Dec. 28.
Sewell signed with the Ducks as a five-star (0.9935 per 247Sports Composite) prospect in the 2020 recruiting class out of Orem (Ut.) High School. He's the second-highest rated linebacker in program history behind only Justin Flowe, who announced his commitment to Arizona this week.

During three successful seasons in Eugene, the 6-foot-3, 250-pound backer totaled 215 tackles, 20.5 tackles for loss, 7.5 sacks and three forced fumbles in 33 games. He lead the Ducks in tackles for two of his three seasons, bursting onto the scene as a true freshman in 2020 and taking home the Coaches Pac-12 Freshman Defensive Player of the Year honors. 
Sewell was a leader on defense from day one and made an instant impact once he stepped on the field during the COVID-shortened 2020 season.
The American Samoa native is following in his older brother Penei Sewell's footsteps heading to the league after a stellar career in Eugene. He's the third Duck from the 2022 roster to declare for the NFL Draft along with outside linebacker DJ Johnson and cornerback Christian Gonzalez.

https://www.si.com/college/oregon/recruiting/peyton-bowen-flips-commitment-from-oregon-to-oklahoma,Peyton Bowen Flips From Oregon to Oklahoma,"The Ducks miss out on an elite safety right after earning his verbal commitment.
Denton (Tex.) Guyer safety Peyton Bowen has flipped his commitment from Oregon to Oklahoma. He announced his decision on social media.
""I want to thank Coach Lanning, Coach Lupoi, and Coach Powledge for offering me the opportunity to join your great program,"" Bowen wrote in a social media post. ""Soon after choosing Oregon yesterday morning, I came to the realization that the decision was not the best path for me. I immediately started to rethink my future.""
Bowen flipped his long-standing commitment from Notre Dame to Oregon on Wednesday, one that he made back in January. His commitment came after the Ducks hosted him on campus for multiple visits, and he was one of two players Oregon flipped from Notre Dame during the early signing period, with running back Jayden Limar being the other.
However, a signed letter of intent was never submitted from Bowen, which left the door open for Oklahoma. 
With the All-American safety now off to Norman to play his college football, the Ducks still signed two talented safeties to their 2023 class on Wednesday in Kodi DeCambra from Bishop Gorman in Las Vegas and Tyler Turner from Brennan High School in San Antonio.
Dan Lanning and Tosh Lupoi's defense definitely got better, as the Ducks signed five-star edge rusher Matayo Uiagaleleli and flipped Southern California cornerback Daylen Austin from the LSU Tigers. On Thursday, they received a signed national letter of intent from Blake Purchase, the top linebacker and overall player in Colorado after Deion Sanders pushed for a flip.

https://www.si.com/college/oregon/recruiting/jordan-anderson-commits-to-oregon-ducks,QUAACK: Jordan Anderson Commits to Oregon,"The Ducks stay hot with the addition of an elite wide receiver.
The Ducks continue to recruit at an unreal clip.
On Thursday morning, Long Beach (Calif.) Millikan wide receiver Jordan Anderson committed to Oregon, announcing his commitment on social media.
The 6-foot, 165-pound wide receiver chose Oregon from a top 11 that also included schools like Washington, USC, Tennessee and Michigan.
He's rated a four-star (0.9560) prospect according to the 247Sports Composite. The same system ranks him the No. 83 player in the country, the No. 13 wide receiver and the No. 11 recruit in California. 
Anderson is the second wide receiver to pledge to Oregon in 2024, joining Philadelphia (Pa.) Roman Catholic's Tyseer Denmark, who committed on Thanksgiving. Despite having just four verbal pledges, Dan Lanning's 2024 recruiting class is ranked No. 6 in the country according to the 247 Sports rankings. 
Jordan Anderson is one of the best wide receivers in the country. Plain and simple.
I've seen him in person multiple times this season and what really stands out about the Millikan product are his hands, speed, quickness and playmaking ability. He's a reliable pass catcher who can really hurt you after the catch.
Anderson possesses great body control, short area burst and top-end speed. Skills like that also helped him shine in the return game for the Rams this season.
If there's one knock, if you can call it that, I'd have to say it would be his size. Ideally he'd add some more weight to his 6-foot frame once he gets to the next level.
Finally, we have to talk about Junior Adams. 
Because he's tearing up the recruiting trail once again. In the span of just a few weeks he's landed Traeshon Holden from Alabama out of the transfer portal, and he got Jurrion Dickey, Oregon's top offensive recruit in 2023, to sign his national letter of intent during the early signing period after he was previously considering signing in February.
He parlayed that momentum into 2024 and got one of California's top wideouts and most electric playmakers in the fold on Thursday. If people haven't been already, it's time to start taking Junior Adams seriously as one of the best recruiters out West and in the Pac-12.

It feels like a cherry on top for the Ducks.
After a crazy stretch on the opening day of the early signing period, East Palo Alto (Calif.) wide receiver Jurrion Dickey has signed his national letter of intent with Oregon.
This is a huge move for Dan Lanning and his coaching staff, as despite being committed to Oregon since April, it wasn't a sure thing that he was going to sign his letter of intent during the early signing period. In fact, when he spoke to Ducks Digest back in October he was leaning more toward signing in February.
Tennessee, Texas A&M and Penn State all continued to pursue the Adidas All-American, who received numerous high-profile offers after earning five-star status as a recruit over the summer.

But Oregon stayed true and continued to recruit their star wide receiver in the 2023 recruiting class.
The 6-foot-3, 210-pound wideout from East Palo Alto, California is rated a five-star (0.9918) recruit on the 247Sports Composite. The same system ranks him as the No. 15 player in the country, the No. 2 wide receiver and the No. 3 player in California. 
He's the No. 9 ranked all-time recruit in Oregon program history according to 247Sports. The only other Duck wide receiver ranked above him is Cameron Colvin (0.9932) in the 2004 recruiting class.
Dickey is one of three wide receivers in Oregon's 2023 recruiting class along with Ashton Cozart from Flower Mound (Tex.) Marcus High School and former Alabama wide receiver Traeshon Holden.
The California standout joins a position group in Eugene that features fellow East Palo Alto native Troy Franklin, Kris Hutson, Kyler Kasper and Josh Delgado among others. He'll be coached by Junior Adams, who's also a Bay Area native.
Oregon's 2023 recruiting class is ranked No. 8 nationally and No. 5 in the transfer portal according to 247Sports. The Ducks have 25 signed national letters of intent and are only awaiting three more signatures from 2023 commits in Peyton Bowen, Blake Purchase and George Silva.

Oregon is continuing to prove themselves in the early signing period. If adding two-five stars and flopping two four-star flip commitments on day one wasn’t enough to get you excited, the Ducks just added another huge name.
Former Rhode Island offensive lineman Ajani Cornelius has committed to the Oregon Ducks. He announced his commitment on the 247Sports YouTube channel.
Ranked as the No. 18 overall transfer portal player by 247Sports, Cornelius quickly became a hot name in the portal after spending the last three seasons with the Rams.
READ MORE: Oregon flips RB Jayden Limar from Notre Dame 
Cornelius is listed at 6'4"", 315 pounds and mainly plays right tackle. What makes him most impressive is how he came out of high school unranked in 2020 but quickly proved to others that he can play big-time football with his size and physical ability. He earned First Team All-CAA Football honors while starting all 11 games last season. 
Once he hit the transfer portal in at the end of November offers began to pour in for Cornelius. A day after announcing his entry Dan Lanning made the move to offer the interior lineman, making it his 17th offer in one day.
After taking visits to Oregon, Ohio State, Tennessee and Nebraska, Cornelius narrowed his list to those four schools. He joins a great group from the 2023 recruiting class that already features six offensive linemen.
The current offensive line haul consists of Iapani Laloulu (Honolulu, HI), Geroge Silva (Fullerton CA), Lipe Moala (Santa Ana, CA), Gernorris Wilson (Lakeland, FL) Bryce Boulton (Palm Desert, CA) and Texas transfer Junior Angilau (Salt Lake City, UT). 
With his experience and size, Cornelius should make for a great fit into Will Stein's new offense next season, especially with the departure of multiple veterans like T.J. Bass and Malaesala Aumavae-Laulu.

2023 Long Beach (Calif.) Poly cornerback Daylen Austin has flipped his commitment from the LSU Tigers to the Oregon Ducks.
He announced his decision on social media. 
Austin had been committed to LSU since May, but the Ducks never stopped recruiting him. They brought him out to Eugene for numerous visits since Dan Lanning was hired as the new coach and felt like the team to beat for some time despite his pledge to the Tigers.
The 6-foot-1, 180-pound defensive back went on to sign his national letter of intent with the Ducks on Wednesday afternoon as an added bonus to a phenomenal day for the Oregon staff. 
READ MORE: Matayo Uiagalelei commits to Oregon over USC and Ohio State
Oregon's newest defensive back pledge is rated a four-star (0.9495) prospect according to the 247Sports Composite. The same system ranks him the No. 109 player nationally, the No. 12 cornerback and the No. 9 player in California.
Austin is one of four players to flip his commitment to Oregon on Wednesday, as the Ducks also landed pledges from safety Peyton Bowen (Notre Dame), quarterback Austin Novosad (Baylor) and running back Jayden Limar.
This was especially welcome news for the Ducks as they saw cornerback Caleb Presley flip his commitment from Oregon to Washington on Wednesday. 
The Long Beach Poly product joins a secondary that features cornerback Cole Martin (signed), defensive back Collin Gill (signed), safety Kodi DeCambra (signed), safety Tyler Turner (signed) and Alabama transfer cornerback Khyree Jackson. As a senior Austin helped lead the Long Beach Poly Jack Rabbits to another Moore league title in addition to being named Moore League MVP.

It's spatula season across the world of college football recruiting and Oregon just pulled off another big one.
2023 Lake Stevens (Wash.) running back Jayden Limar has flipped his commitment from the Notre Dame Fighting Irish to the Oregon Ducks.
He announced his decision on social media. 
Limar committed to Notre Dame in May from a top four that also included Arizona, Michigan and Oregon. The Ducks stayed in the picture and contact really picked up in the last month, with running backs coach Carlos Locklyn attending his state title game in Washington. 
READ MORE: Oregon flips five-star safety Peyton Bowen from Notre Dame
That was followed by an in-home visit from Locklyn in Lake Stevens last week and the coaching staff brought him out to Eugene for a visit over the weekend, which was the perfect chance to seal the deal. 
Limar's commitment is some positive news the Ducks needed after All-American quarterback Dante Moore flipped his commitment to UCLA on Monday.
Rated a four-star (0.9081) prospect by the 247Sports composite, the same system ranks Limar the No. 276 recruit nationally, the No. 17 running back and the No. 2 prospect in the state of Washington for the class of 2023.
The 5-foot-11, 190-pound ballcarrier becomes the second running back in Oregon's 2023 recruiting class, joining U.S. Army All-American Bowl selection Dante Dowdell out of Mississippi. He adds a new dynamic to an Oregon running back room that is projected to return Bucky Irving, Noah Whittington and Jordan James from the 2022 season after Sean Dollars and Byron Cardwell entered the transfer portal.
Limar rushed for over 2,000 yards and 36 touchdowns his senior season and averaged 9.1 yards per carry. His commitment is a great pairing with the 6-foot-2, 215-pound Dowdell, as he can serve as a change-of-pace option for Oregon's offense under new coordinator Will Stein.
Other big names to monitor on the recruiting trail for the Ducks include defensive lineman Ashton Porter and offensive lineman Ajani Cornelus who were both on campus in Eugene for visits this month.

2023 cornerback Caleb Presley has flipped his commitment from the Oregon Ducks to the Washington Huskies.
He announced his decision on social media.
Presley is rated a four-star recruit (0.9310) per 247Sports Composite. He's ranked No. 166 nationally, the No. 19 cornerback position and the No. 1 player in Washington. He had been committed to the Ducks since the beginning of July prior to flipping Wednesday. 
The four-star was able to visit both Washington and Oregon in back-to-back weeks in the beginning of December before making his early signing period decision. He's now the Huskies' highest-rated recruit for the 2023 class. 
He will be joining with four-star Curley Reed and three-star Leroy Bryant, as well as Diesel Gordon and Thaddeus Dixon in Washington's secondary haul for 2023.

Prior to Presley's decision to flip, Oregon was able to get a commitment from Long Beach (Calif.) Poly cornerback Daylen Austin, who's ranked No. 12 at his position and the No. 9 player in California.
Along with Austin the Ducks got another cornerback commitment from Alabama transfer Khyree Jackson earlier this month. They've also added four-star Cole Martin and three-star Collin Gill after signing their national letters of intent on Wednesday.
The defensive back group is one of the areas that the Ducks need to get fixed for next season as there were times of inconsistency this season. With the addition of these great players and a coaching staff ready to build from their mistakes, this could be one of the most improved position groups on the field next season.
