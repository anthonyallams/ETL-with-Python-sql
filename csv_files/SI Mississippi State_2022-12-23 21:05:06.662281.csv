Mississippi State defensive end Randy Charlton will be taking his talents to the next level.
Charlton announced his intentions to enter the 2023 NFL Draft on Thursday afternoon. Along with this announcement, he shared that he will be playing for the Bulldogs in the ReliaQuest Bowl on Jan. 2nd rather than choosing to opt out. 
The fifth-year player out of Miami, Florida, put up big numbers during his time wearing the Maroon and White. Through two seasons, Charlton recorded 68 total tackles, 11 tackles-for-loss and seven sacks. He also had one forced fumble each year.
Charlton began his collegiate career at UCF, where he was a defensive standout from 2018-2020. He saw gridiron action in 33 games and totaled 67 tackles, four sacks and four passes defended. 
One of Charlton's biggest career plays cemented him into Egg Bowl lore. During the team's 2022 matchup against Ole Miss, he broke up a crucial two-point play for the Rebels that would have tied the game at 24 points apiece late in the fourth quarter. That sealed the deal for the Bulldogs and gave late head coach Mike Leach his first-ever Egg Bowl win. 
NFL Mock Draft Database currently projects that Charlton will be an undrafted free agent, but he has plenty of chances to prove himself and climb up the boards before the big weekend arrives. The 2023 NFL Draft will begin on April 27th and run through April 29th. ","Sports Illustrated Mississippi State Football, Basketball, Recruiting, and More","Football, Randy charlton, 2023 nfl draft, Mississippi state football",Elizabeth keen,"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 11:00:00 GMT",Charlton will be taking his talents to the next level but plans to play in the ReliaQuest Bowl in early January.,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMDA3MTU0NDQ4MzEyMDE2/usatsi_13549080.jpg

National Signing Day was successful for many SEC teams, including Mississippi State.
According to 247Sports, the Bulldogs have the No. 24-ranked signing class in the nation and the 10th-best in the SEC. Many standouts from the Class of 2023 officially signed with the team on Wednesday, including four four-star athletes and 20 three-star athletes. The class consists of 12 offensive players, 14 defensive standouts and one special-teams player. 
New MSU head coach Zach Arnett recently took over the program following the death of Mike Leach. He held the class together in the week following the tragedy within the program and even managed to flip a few recruits from other SEC schools, most notably top-10 safety Isaac Smith. 
Alabama leads both the SEC and the nation, while Georgia sits just behind the Crimson Tide at No. 2 overall. LSU (No. 7) and Tennessee (No. 9) round out conference representation in the top 10. There are 10 total SEC teams ranked in the top 25.
Vanderbilt has the worst class in the SEC, which ranks No. 50 overall. Surprisingly, Ole Miss brought in the second-lowest recruiting class in the conference with a No. 36 overall standing. The Rebels signed just 12 players, but seven of them are four-star signees.
Here is a list of each of the 14 SEC teams in the national rankings, along with their points. 247Sports updated these standings late Thursday night.

Zach Arnett was officially named the Mississippi State head football coach of Dec. 15, following the unexpected passing of former Bulldogs head coach Mike Leach.
While Arnett is faces a large task in moving into this role after being promoted from defensive coordinator, the amount of success he's had and the dominance of his defenses both at San Diego State and Mississippi State bode well for the future.
The two-time nominee for the Broyles Award met with the medias Wednesday to address future plans and the state of the program as it prepares to move forward under him.
He indicated that passing game coordinator Steve Spurrier Jr. would the handing the offensive play-calling while he would handle the defensive side of the ball in the upcoming ReliaQuest Bowl.
Things will obviously be different in the absence of Leach, but there's a lot to celebrated coming off of Early Signing Day as the Bulldogs put together yet another strong class that will pay dividends in the future.
""I think today’s success, the class we put together, the guys we have in it, who we had committed prior to the tragic news of Coach Leach’s passing, and stayed with us sends quite the statement about the young men we were recruiting, the families they come from, and says a whole lot about the entire program,"" Arnett said.
""The coaches that went on the road, got into the homes and spent time with them, and reaffirmed why the guys were committed to us in the first place. It says a lot about our locker room, those guys developed relationships with the young men on our team, and nothing changed. It was a constant in the locker room and they want to be part of his program because they relate to the guys in the locker room. They’re Mississippi State kind of guys. Coaches who recruited, recruiting staff who put in a lot of hard, unrecognized hours did a tremendous job. We’re enjoying the fruits of our labor today.""

Early Signing Day is officially upon us, despite the start of the 2023 college football season still looming several months away.

Mississippi State wide receiver Jamire Calvin has chosen to declare for the 2023 NFL Draft. 
Calvin shared his decision on Tuesday evening with a social media statement that featured the NFL Draft logo. The graduate student spent four seasons at Washington State and transferred to MSU in 2021 after former head coach Mike Leach's first year with the program. 
The wideout appeared in 30 games for the Cougars, opting to redshirt during his 2019 junior season. Calvin totaled 92 receptions for 980 total yards with five touchdowns during his time in Pullman and had two games with at least 100 receiving yards. He was named to the Pac-12 All-Freshman Second Team by SB Nation in 2017. 
Upon arriving in Starkville, Calvin saw his playing time continue with the Bulldogs. He appeared in all 13 of the team's games and notched 220 receiving yards and three touchdowns on 29 catches. Two of those touchdowns helped Mississippi State string together a massive 25-point comeback against the Auburn Tigers and proved to be the difference makers in the game. 
In 2022, Calvin hauled in 11 receptions for 58 yards and one touchdown in 10 appearances. He also rose to social media fame after a viral video emerged of him dancing behind Leach during the team's Egg Bowl victory. 
Calvin will now look to make his presence known in the pros. The 2023 NFL Draft is set to begin on April 27th and will run through April 29th. The event will be held in Kansas City, Missouri. ","Sports Illustrated Mississippi State Football, Basketball, Recruiting, and More","Jamire calvin, Football, Mississippi state football, 2023 nfl draft",Elizabeth keen,"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 11:15:00 GMT",Calvin plans to enter the 2023 NFL Draft.,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg0MjcyMjIzMzcxMDExNTYy/usatsi_9769197-2.jpg

College baseball season might be a few months away, but Mississippi State is already listed in one particular preseason poll that was released on Tuesday. 
Collegiate Baseball ranked the Bulldogs as the No. 22 team in the organization's annual preseason poll. A total of 12 SEC programs were represented in the standings, with the lone outliers being Missouri and Kentucky. The loaded LSU Tigers sit atop the poll, while Florida, Texas A&M, Tennessee, Arkansas and Vanderbilt are also in the top 10.
In-state rival Southern Miss is the highest-ranked team from the Magnolia State, coming in at No. 18. Defending national champion Ole Miss is two spots behind Mississippi State at 24th overall. 
The Bulldogs had a disappointing 2022 season just one year after winning the CWS National Championship for the first time in program history. They finished with a 26-30 overall record -- including 9-21 in conference play -- and missed out on the postseason completely.
Now, MSU has assembled a very new team after plenty of roster turnover in the offseason. Many of the program's talented pitchers that saw time last season are returning, but the batting order is expected to feature quite a few new faces.

Mississippi State's undefeated men's basketball squad has been steadily climbing in the AP Poll over the last few weeks.
The Bulldogs (11-0) jumped up two spots to No. 15 in the rankings this weekend. They are behind just three SEC foes in the standings: Tennessee (No. 8), Alabama (No. 9) and Arkansas (No. 10). Kentucky and Auburn sit in 19th place and 23rd place, respectively, to round out conference representation. 
Despite facing some challenges last week, MSU is one of just five undefeated college basketball teams in the nation and the only SEC program with a goose egg in the loss column. The team survived a back-and-forth contest against JSU in the Mississippi Coliseum on Wednesday to pick up a 69-59 victory. Over the weekend, it held off a late comeback attempt by Nicholls State to maintain its perfect record.
Throughout this season's non-conference slate, Tolu Smith has been the shining star for Mississippi State. The redshirt senior has averaged 16.2 points and 8.9 rebounds per game while boasting a field goal percentage of 61.9 percent. He is backed up by a competitive group of teammates that have each stepped up in big ways to help the program find success.
Before SEC play begins, MSU has one more game remaining against Drake. The Bulldogs will face off against a team with the same mascot in hopes of rounding out non-conference play with a perfect 12-0 record. From there, things will get a bit harder for the program. Mississippi State will open SEC play against Alabama on Dec. 28 before traveling to Tennessee and hosting Ole Miss to kick off a packed few months of games. 
MSU will face off against Drake on Tuesday afternoon at the Battle in the Vault in Lincoln, Nebraska. Tipoff is set for 4 p.m. CT, and the game can be streamed on Baller TV. ","Sports Illustrated Mississippi State Football, Basketball, Recruiting, and More","Tolu smith, Mississippi state men's basketball, Ncaa basketball ap poll, Basketball",Elizabeth keen,"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 11:00:00 GMT",The Bulldogs are listed at No. 15 in this week's rankings.,https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTc5MDIwMjk2NTYwOTc3NDE1/usatsi_13870875.jpg

Mississippi State will honor the life of deceased head football coach Mike Leach on Tuesday afternoon.

https://www.si.com/college/mississippistate/football/dak-prescott-dallas-cowboys-clinch-nfl-playoff-berth,"Dak Prescott, Dallas Cowboys Clinch NFL Playoff Spot","Despite losing on Sunday, the Cowboys have reached the postseason for the second straight season.
Former Mississippi State quarterback Dak Prescott will be leading his Dallas Cowboys into the NFL Playoffs once again.
Despite a 40-34 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday afternoon, the Cowboys (10-4) were able to secure a spot in the postseason with a little help from an NFC East foe. The New York Giants took down the Washington Commanders by a score of 20-12 late Sunday night, giving the Cowboys the green light.
The NFL's tiebreaker rules allowed Dallas to be given a guaranteed a playoff spot with three games remaining this year. The team can't finish worse than 7-5 in the NFC, and no more than two conference opponents can finish with a better record. 
The Cowboys will most likely fill a Wild Card spot, but there's a very slim chance that they could claim the NFC East crown in just a few weeks. For that to happen, the Philadelphia Eagles (13-1) will need to lose their remaining three games, while Dallas must win out. Ironically, the two teams will face each other on Saturday: a game that the Cowboys must win by double digits to make up for a nine-point loss to the Eagles that came earlier this season. 
Prescott started strong in Sunday's loss to the Jaguars, but he couldn't close the game out. The veteran signal-caller went 23-of-30 passing for 256 yards with three touchdowns and two interceptions. One of those turnovers was a pick-six in overtime to give Jacksonville the victory. He also had five rushing attempts for 20 yards. 
In his seven seasons in the NFL, Prescott has now made the playoffs four times. He has a 1-3 record in the postseason, with his lone win coming against the Seattle Seahawks during Super Wild Card Weekend in 2018. This is the first time in Prescott's career that he has outlasted the regular season in two consecutive seasons, and the team has not done so since 2006 and 2007.
Dallas closes out its regular season by hosting the Eagles on Saturday before traveling to face the Tennessee Titans and the Washington Commanders. The NFL Playoffs will begin with the Wild Card Round, which starts on Saturday, Jan. 14 and runs through Monday, Jan. 16. ","Sports Illustrated Mississippi State Football, Basketball, Recruiting, and More","Dak prescott, Football, Dallas cowboys, Nfl football",Elizabeth keen,"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 11:00:00 GMT","Despite losing on Sunday, the Cowboys have reached the postseason for the second straight season.",https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg5NjcyMzA4MzAwODUwMzcz/usatsi_17524432.jpg

Illinois will be without two of its star defenders as it faces Mississippi State in the ReliaQuest Bowl. 
Defensive backs Devon Witherspoon and Sydney Brown have each opted out of the Fighting Illini's postseason matchup. Both released individual statements sharing that they have their sights set on the 2023 NFL Draft. Stepping away from bowl games has become a common trend for many young athletes who look to excel at the next level and don't want to risk an injury. 
Witherspoon finished the season as one of the top defensive backs in the nation. He recorded 41 tackles, 2.5 tackles-for-loss and 14 pass breakups. The elusive defender also hauled in three interceptions throughout the season that he returned for a combined 97 yards. 
The junior out of Pensacola, Florida, was the Big Ten Conference Defensive Back of the Year and a finalist for the Jim Thorpe Award. He was also a consensus All-American, with first-team selections from The Associated Press, the American Football Coaches Association, the Football Writers Association of America and the Walter Camp Football Foundation. 
Brown proved to be the perfect partner for Witherspoon throughout the season. The London, Ontario native totaled six interceptions on the year, including one that was returned for a touchdown. He also had 59 tackles, 3.5 tackles-for-loss, seven pass breakups and one fumble recovery. 
Mississippi State still has work to do against Illinois' tough defense, but things might have gotten a bit easier without two star defensive backs in the mix. The Bulldogs will run the Air Raid offense in their first game since former head coach Mike Leach's death, and going up against a less-experienced secondary could help them be even more successful. 
The ReliaQuest Bowl will be held in Tampa, Florida, on Jan. 2nd.
